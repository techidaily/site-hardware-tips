Today at Google I&#x2F;O, the company revealed more about its first folding phone.</p><p> The Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone, in the same form factor as the Samsung <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unlock-reddit-potentials-stepwise-procedures-for-sharing/" >Galaxy Z Fold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There’s a “table-top mode” in YouTube, with the video on one side of the fold and other information on the other side of the screen. Google also showed off a live translation mode in Google Translate, where each screen is used for the other person’s conversations.</p><p> You can now <a class="link"   href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Ffold" >pre-order the Pixel Fold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the Google Store for $1799 and will start to ship next month.

Here’s what you need to know to make the decision for yourself.</p><h2 id="​Google-Messages-Has-Replaced-Samsung-Messages"><a href="#​Google-Messages-Has-Replaced-Samsung-Messages" class="headerlink" title="​Google Messages Has Replaced Samsung Messages"></a>​Google Messages Has Replaced Samsung Messages</h2><p> For many years, <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.samsung.android.messaging&cId=000006069058" >Samsung Messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was Samsung’s go-to texting app. Now, even though Samsung Messages is still around, the company’s phones default to <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002954/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging" >Google Messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Why?</p><p> In the US, virtually all Android phones now come with Google Messages by default. Google has encouraged OEMs to adopt the app, and the three major carriers <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ps5-expansion-leading-external-drives-unveiled/" >began preloading Google Messages on all Android phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2021 as a way to implement RCS support.</p><p> There are also ways in which Google Messages is simply the better app, and now Samsung does not have to compete. Even if you attempt to use the preinstalled Samsung Messages app in the US, the app <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ow-to-keep-unwanted-content-away-from-your-computer-and-phone/" >may still nudge you to use Google Messages instead <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1000060161.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Messages recommending the user of Google Messages instead."                > </p><p> Of course, you’re free to ignore this recommendation and continue to use Samsung Messages, but is there a good reason to?</p><h2 id="​Reasons-You-May-Still-Prefer-Samsung-Messages"><a href="#​Reasons-You-May-Still-Prefer-Samsung-Messages" class="headerlink" title="​Reasons You May Still Prefer Samsung Messages"></a>​Reasons You May Still Prefer Samsung Messages</h2><p> Samsung Messages has had a long run. It’s mature software, and, for millions of people, it’s familiar. It’s also still a pretty solid app.</p><p>Close </p><p> One thing Samsung Messages has going for it is its simplicity. If you’ve ever used a texting app on a smartphone before, then you know how it works. SMS and MMS have been around longer than many of us have been alive.</p><p> There’s also something appealing about an app that doesn’t suggest you create an account and <a class="link"   href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-top-10-windows-camera-apps-reviewed/" >make your chats available online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Samsung Messages just does what it’s supposed to do. Nothing more.</p><h3 id="Consistency-With-Other-Samsung-Apps"><a href="#Consistency-With-Other-Samsung-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Consistency With Other Samsung Apps"></a>Consistency With Other Samsung Apps</h3><p> Samsung’s One UI has its own vibe. It’s not nearly as distinct from what you see on a Pixel as Samsung’s TouchWiz used to be, but there remains a noticeable stylistic difference.</p><p> If you want your core phone apps to look and feel the same, then that’s also a good reason to stick with Samsung’s messaging app. It has the same look as the Phone app and the Contacts app. It also looks comparable to the Settings app, as well as other Samsung apps like Samsung Notes and Samsung Music.</p><h3 id="Sort-and-Customize-Your-Chats"><a href="#Sort-and-Customize-Your-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Sort and Customize Your Chats"></a>Sort and Customize Your Chats</h3><p>Close </p><p> There are some niceties that Samsung’s app provides that Google’s does not. For example, you can manually create categories and sort your conversations into groups (Google Messages used to have categories, but now, instead of <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/forge-viral-content-adobe-memes/" >disabling this option manually <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Google has turned it off for good).</p><p> You can also adjust the background color of your conversations to give them a personalized spark.</p><h3 id="No-Google-Bloat"><a href="#No-Google-Bloat" class="headerlink" title="No Google Bloat"></a>No Google Bloat</h3><p> Google Messages looks and feels like a Google product. There’s Google branding at the top, and hitting the menu button pulls up your Google accounts. This is similar to other Google apps like Google Photos, Gmail, and Google Calendar. Each one blurs the line between what’s on your phone and what’s online.</p><p> This probably won’t stand out if you are already immersed in Google’s ecosystem, but one of the advantages of Galaxy phones is that <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-an-examination-of-photoshops-anti-shake-capabilities/" >Samsung makes great phone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that aren’t trying to be more than that.</p><h2 id="Advantages-of-Google-Messages-Over-Samsung-Messages"><a href="#Advantages-of-Google-Messages-Over-Samsung-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Google Messages Over Samsung Messages"></a>Advantages of Google Messages Over Samsung Messages</h2><p> For most people, Google Messages is the preferable app—it’s built using more modern technology. Despite coming from Google, it offers a greater degree of privacy. It also offers more features. Let’s break them down.</p><h3 id="Google-Messages-Supports-RCS-on-Any-Android-Phone"><a href="#Google-Messages-Supports-RCS-on-Any-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Google Messages Supports RCS on Any Android Phone"></a>Google Messages Supports RCS on Any Android Phone</h3><p>Close </p><p> RCS, or the Rich Communication Service, is <a class="link"   href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ideal-chat-and-meetup-tools-for-large-groups/" >the successor to SMS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. RCS supports functionality that you may have come to expect from online services, such as seeing whether someone is typing or that they’ve viewed your messages.</p><p> Google Messages offers RCS support across any carrier. It is the most widely used version of RCS for Android and has become the platform’s most viable competitor to <a class="link"   href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/find-updated-printing-drivers-for-ricoh-mpc3003-download-now/" >Apple’s iMessage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Samsung Messages previously supported RCS, but it was dependent on your carrier. After embracing Google Messages as its new default, Samsung removed RCS functionality from Samsung Messages on newer phones.</p><h3 id="Keep-Chats-Private-With-End-to-End-Encryption"><a href="#Keep-Chats-Private-With-End-to-End-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Keep Chats Private With End-to-End Encryption"></a>Keep Chats Private With End-to-End Encryption</h3><p> One of the most important advantages of RCS is support for <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-13-creative-ways-to-save-and-store-online-audio-broadcasts/" >end-to-end encryption <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This means RCS chats within Google Messages are private. Ideally, even Google shouldn’t be able to read them.</p><p> This encryption is enabled by default. You know your message is private when you see a lock underneath a message or by checking your conversation settings.</p><p> Non-RCS messages continue to lack encryption. So, if you’re using Google Messages to send SMS or MMS, that message is as unencrypted and as private as ever. That’s because of the inherent infrastructure of the technology, not the app. SMS messages are insecure, and that isn’t Google’s fault.</p><h3 id="Modern-Ways-to-React-to-Messages"><a href="#Modern-Ways-to-React-to-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Modern Ways to React to Messages"></a>Modern Ways to React to Messages</h3><p>Close </p><p> SMS can deliver a short message with a limit of 140 characters. MMS expands the number of characters and allows you to attach an image or other media file. This is pretty basic compared to chatting on WhatsApp or Signal. It was already dated in the days of Yahoo Instant Messenger and Trillian. RCS and Google Messages bring texting into the present.</p><p> In Google Messages, you can <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unleash-your-potential-skyrocketing-youtube-audience/" >like a message with a thumbs-up emoji or a heart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can react with any emoji, really, or try a GIF or sticker instead. Voice messages are embedded directly into the conversation. This all makes Google Messages feel at home alongside the other apps you use for keeping up with people.</p><h3 id="Auto-Delete-OTPs-and-Spam-Protection"><a href="#Auto-Delete-OTPs-and-Spam-Protection" class="headerlink" title="Auto-Delete OTPs and Spam Protection"></a>Auto-Delete OTPs and Spam Protection</h3><p> Need to sign in to a website? It’s probably going to send you a text to verify your identity. Over the course of a single day, these one-time passwords can push your current conversations off the screen. Google Messages is able to identify and <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-art-of-digital-retrieval-saving-and-storing-chats-on-fb/" >automatically delete OTPs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after a day or so.</p><p> Google’s chat app also offers some protection against spam. Taken together, these features help your texting experience stay focused on the people you actually message. Frankly, these are only a fraction of the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/revealing-the-smarts-of-z2-play-mobile-for-2024/" >features you can find in Google Messages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><p> If you’re willing to give up the advantages of RCS, then Samsung Messages is arguably the better app for sending SMS. But that’s a big “if.”</p><p> Once you grow accustomed to receiving read receipts and leaving reactions to people’s messages, it’s hard to give them up. These additions aren’t gimmicks. Often, a thumbs up is all that needs to be “said” and avoids sparking the anxiety that comes from sending someone “okay” instead of “ok” (really, though, it’s “kk”).</p><p> Plus end-to-end encryption is increasingly important when so much of our personal lives are now conducted through our devices. You don’t have to be a fan of Google to, like Samsung itself, nudge people toward Google Messages instead.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The new iPad Pro is just the latest refinement of Apple’s tablet. But boy is it a refinement. It looks familiar but feels substantially different. Until I held it, I didn’t realize I wanted my iPad to be even lighter and thinner than it had been. Now after experiencing it, I would hate to go back.</p><p> The other major part of the hardware’s refinement is its screen. I would say the OLED is the primary reason to consider buying a new iPad Pro or upgrading from an older one. The weight and size are nice, while the screen is this device’s allure.</p><p> The 11-inch iPad Pro might be one of the best travel TVs in the world. (Its price reflects that achievement as well.) Even sitting in a room with a TV on the wall, during testing, I opted to watch movies and TV shows on the new iPad Pro. I’ll take a smaller screen size with darker blacks and more vibrant colors any day—especially considering my <a class="link"   href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/understanding-and-solving-the-unautnhorized-access-detected-error-in-games/" >current TV situation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Text in all forms looked much crisper than on my 5th-generation iPad Air. The brightness was noticeable. At nearly every turn, the screen was just wonderful. It is <a class="link"   href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-high-end-desktops-for-professionals/" >two OLED panels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stacked on top of each other after all. So it should continue to look great long into the future too.</p><p> New this year, the iPad Pro is now capable of 1,000 nits of SDR brightness and 1,600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content. The 4th-generation 11-inch iPad Pro had a peak brightness of 600 nits and my previous 5th-generation iPad Air reached 500 nits of peak brightness.</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-correctly-address-msstdfmtdll-file-absence-on-windows-computers/" >Apple Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also amazing for watching videos, but it’s more limited in its battery life and seclusion. The iPad Pro, on the other hand, is easy to pick up and move around the house and share with someone else.</p><p> With the new aluminum-clad Magic Keyboard the iPad Pro feels more like a Mac than ever. This is especially true because it’s the only device with the newest M4 processing chip. These new 11- and 13-inch iPads Pro get the M4 chip just two months after the MacBook Air got an M3 chip.</p><p> Having the fastest entry-level M-series chip may be mostly academic, however. I couldn’t <em>feel</em> the speed increase of the new chip. On the 256GB and 512GB models, you’re getting a 9-core CPU with 3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU. The 1TB and 2TB models get 4 performance cores, but even the ones with binned chips are beating the M3 chips in benchmark tests. It’s all just a lot of potential power.</p><p> One caveat to not feeling the speed increase right now would be for people who use Logic Pro or Final Cut iPad apps. Those users may see real time savings. There are just very few ways to stress the iPad Pro to its full capabilities.</p><p> Maybe the next version of iPadOS will find new ways to push the advanced hardware, but until something substantially changes in <em>how</em> people use iPads, the M4 chip is nice but probably hard to use as a justification for upgrading from another M-series-based iPad. For what it’s worth, my MacBook Air has a now meager M2 chip and I haven’t felt any power crunch with it over the last 12 months.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/a-close-up-of-the-front-camera-on-the-apple-ipad-pro-m4.JPG"                      alt="a close up of the front camera on the Apple iPad Pro (M4)"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> One minor detail I did notice and feel was the new placement of the camera used for FaceTime and other video calls. It’s now top and (mostly) centered when using the iPad in landscape orientation.</p><p> Practically, having the camera now on the long side of the iPad Pro means that I now appear to be looking at the camera when doing Zoom calls. It’s a more natural placement and an omission that more people are probably using their iPads horizontally rather than vertically.</p><p> There are very few, if any, missteps with the Pro. The speakers are great, especially for the tablet’s physical size. It’s even hard to get mad at the removal of the second rear camera. Did you even know there were two cameras on Pro iPads? This new hardware is peak iPad.</p><h2 id="You-Can-Only-Pick-Two-Weight-Battery-and-Size"><a href="#You-Can-Only-Pick-Two-Weight-Battery-and-Size" class="headerlink" title="You Can Only Pick Two: Weight, Battery, and Size"></a>You Can Only Pick Two: Weight, Battery, and Size</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/side-view-of-the-apple-ipad-pro-m4-in-magic-keyboard.jpg"                      alt="side view of the Apple iPad Pro (M4) in magic keyboard"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The iPad Pro (M4) is thinner than previous models. It’s lighter. But it doesn’t lose battery life. That part is still stuck at around 10 hours. I know a lot of people would prefer more battery life over an incredibly thin device, but then the weight would also presumably go up and make it worse for travel.</p><p> It’s a delicate balance between weight, size, and battery life. Before getting my hands on the new tablet I might have argued that there should be more than 10 hours of battery life. After using it, however, I appreciate losing weight and thickness while keeping the same “all day” battery.</p><p> I took a cross-country flight using this new iPad Pro and I never felt the need to plug it in. I started with a battery around 75% full and used it to write and watch shows for nearly all of the plane ride. I ended with about 50%.</p><p> A lot of people could certainly benefit from more battery life, but as it stands now, everyone gets a tiny bit of weight reduction on a device that’s meant to be carried around.</p><h2 id="Apple-Magic-Keyboard-Is-Probably-a-Critical-Accessory"><a href="#Apple-Magic-Keyboard-Is-Probably-a-Critical-Accessory" class="headerlink" title="Apple Magic Keyboard Is Probably a Critical Accessory"></a>Apple Magic Keyboard Is Probably a Critical Accessory</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/apple-ipad-pro-m4-sitting-on-a-table-in-magic-keyboard.jpg"                      alt="Apple iPad Pro (M4) sitting on a table in Magic Keyboard"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> It’s hard to suggest that people should buy a $1,000 (or more) device so they can then spend $300+ more on an accessory, but if you plan to use the iPad as a productivity machine, then the new Magic Keyboard is essential. (If you’re using it mostly for watching content you can probably skip it.)</p><p> It’s not just that the keyboard is helpful, but it’s really good and enjoyable to use. The new keyboard isn’t overly different from the one that came before it, but it is thoughtfully refined.</p><p> I like the new aluminum top plate for its look and feel. Having a new set of keys above the number row is genuinely handy in adjusting volume and brightness. The larger-sized trackpad with haptics is also smooth and delightful.</p><p> (Selfishly, I wish Apple made the bottom keyboard and trackpad part detachable so I could use it with a Vision Pro. It would be a rad accessory to pair with the company’s headset.)</p><p> I’m less enthusiastic about the Apple Pencil Pro simply because I don’t handwrite notes and can’t draw. The haptics work well when you squeeze it. I appreciate how it’s advanced, but I just have a lot less use for it than the keyboard. If you’re in the same boat and waffling on the decision, then skip it for now and reconsider it later, if new circumstances arise.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Apple-iPad-Pro-M4"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Apple-iPad-Pro-M4" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Apple iPad Pro (M4)?"></a>Should You Buy the Apple iPad Pro (M4)?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/apple-ipad-pro-m4-laying-on-a-bed.JPG"                      alt="Apple iPad Pro (M4) laying on a bed"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Typically, products that use less material have a lower cost. In technology, it’s often the opposite. Smaller, thinner, and lighter devices are more expensive because tiny components are harder to make.</p><p> That’s the story of <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.d4-ocquvYcrfWAAPEjj_uJl1PMlU9HEq9TnejHiPT1nXBv_qQltp783yYCEUyJO7lHul-Q1Qpm-aXSST76mBNo37uzGr3eAtSf87PJ4kqlpCzJc4_lFSEnJP032Mc0_JJlTg1qggjk5v9iRI8Zkfke4KrQfYHiDIXHmPpTbUJw-EwqSH_4Ea-DcvpaUMSCrg-b3lTeDLS1FDtfgj4BNCKU5RajdanKPYAUAw4bGnMns.Ou1nGUVd6_K0HwwSQc7c9pkNiR23mrx6H5INUHAQyZY&dib_tag=se&keywords=ipad+pro+11&qid=1715954902&sr=8-2&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003201&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/apple-ipad-pro-m4-review/&asc_campaign=Authority" >Apple’s iPad Pro (M4) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s nearly the pinnacle of its current design. It’s been squeezed of excess and retails for top dollar. Because of its hardware excellence, I would argue it’s the most tempting device Apple makes right now.</p><p> Its M4 processing chip is faster than the latest MacBook Air and it has a better display than a MacBook Pro. It achieves both of those things while also being the thinnest device Apple has ever made. That’s wild.</p><p> The performance and technology don’t come cheap, however. This might be one of Apple’s best pieces of hardware, but the product’s value is a little out of wack. An 11-inch iPad Pro (M4) with a Magic Keyboard costs more than a 13-inch MacBook Air.</p><p> At the moment, the number of people who need an iPad Pro will be slim, so you’ll have to decide if you’re someone who simply wants one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipad-pro-11-inch-space-black.jpg"                      alt="iPad Pro 11-inch Space Black"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-ec.png"                                     > </p><h5 id="iPad-Pro-M4-11-inch-1"><a href="#iPad-Pro-M4-11-inch-1" class="headerlink" title="iPad Pro (M4) 11-inch"></a>iPad Pro (M4) 11-inch</h5><p>8&#x2F; 10 </p><p>$919 $999 Save $80 </p><p>The new iPad Pro is impossibly thin, featuring outrageous performance with the Apple M4 chip, a breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, and superfast Wi-Fi 6E.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-m4-chip-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/5495362.p?skuId=5495362&extStoreId=188&loc=18069423985" >$999 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003201&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/apple-ipad-pro-m4-review/&asc_campaign=Authority" >$919 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There are a number of common causes and easy fixes you can try.</p><h2 id="What-Does-“Emergency-Calls-Only”-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-“Emergency-Calls-Only”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does “Emergency Calls Only” Mean?"></a>What Does “Emergency Calls Only” Mean?</h2><p> All phones—Android, iPhone, smart, or dumb—are required always to be able to make emergency calls regardless of cellular connection. “Emergency Calls Only” means exactly that: you can only dial emergency numbers. In the US, that means you can still call 911, and the same applies to emergency numbers in other parts of the world.</p><h2 id="Why-Does-My-Phone-Say-“Emergency-Calls-Only”"><a href="#Why-Does-My-Phone-Say-“Emergency-Calls-Only”" class="headerlink" title="Why Does My Phone Say “Emergency Calls Only”?"></a>Why Does My Phone Say “Emergency Calls Only”?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240228-165702.png"                      alt="Emergency Calls Only on Android."                > </p><p> The most common culprits of the “Emergency Calls Only” message all have to do with network connectivity, as you might expect. It often happens if you’re out of your cellular network’s coverage area, your SIM is inactive, or airplane mode was accidentally left enabled. The good news is there are simple fixes to these issues.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-“Emergency-Calls-Only”-on-an-Android-Phone"><a href="#How-to-Fix-“Emergency-Calls-Only”-on-an-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix “Emergency Calls Only” on an Android Phone"></a>How to Fix “Emergency Calls Only” on an Android Phone</h2><p> First and foremost, you may simply be in an area that your cellular network provider doesn’t cover. In this case, the only solution is to try to find a location that does have a signal. If that doesn’t seem to be the issue, we’ve got more fixes for you to try.</p><h3 id="Make-Sure-Your-SIM-Card-Is-Active-and-Inserted-Correctly"><a href="#Make-Sure-Your-SIM-Card-Is-Active-and-Inserted-Correctly" class="headerlink" title="Make Sure Your SIM Card Is Active and Inserted Correctly"></a>Make Sure Your SIM Card Is Active and Inserted Correctly</h3><p> Your SIM—physical or eSIM—is usually at the forefront of what’s causing the “Emergency Calls Only” message to appear. For some reason or another, it’s possible the SIM has become deactivated or wasn’t correctly activated to begin with. Let’s fix that.</p><p> Depending on your phone, go to Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile Networks, or Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; SIMs. Select your SIM and make sure it’s toggled on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240228-162257.png"                      alt="Toggle on SIM on Android."                > </p><h3 id="Check-if-Airplane-Mode-Is-Enabled"><a href="#Check-if-Airplane-Mode-Is-Enabled" class="headerlink" title="Check if Airplane Mode Is Enabled"></a>Check if Airplane Mode Is Enabled</h3><p> Airplane mode disables all the wireless connectivity on your phone, including cellular. So, if airplane mode is enabled, you won’t be able to make phone calls, and the “Emergency Calls Only” message will appear. Let’s fix that.</p><p> Swipe down once or twice from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings menu. Look for the “Airplane Mode” toggle—usually an airplane icon—and make sure it’s not enabled. Tap it to turn it off if it’s on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240227-153801.png"                      alt="Turning off Airplane Mode."                > </p><h3 id="Manually-Select-Your-Cellular-Provider"><a href="#Manually-Select-Your-Cellular-Provider" class="headerlink" title="Manually Select Your Cellular Provider"></a>Manually Select Your Cellular Provider</h3><p> Typically, when you insert a SIM card or activate an eSIM, your Android phone will automatically detect the provider (T-Mobile, Google Fi, Verizon, etc). If that doesn’t work smoothly, you can always go in and manually select it yourself.</p><p> Go to Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile Networks or Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; SIMs. Select your SIM and toggle off “Automatically Select Network,” then choose your network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240227-162848-1.png"                      alt="Turning off &quot;Automatically Select Network&quot; on Android."                > </p><h3 id="Downgrade-to-3G-for-Better-Cell-Signal"><a href="#Downgrade-to-3G-for-Better-Cell-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Downgrade to 3G for Better Cell Signal"></a>Downgrade to 3G for Better Cell Signal</h3><p> Nowadays, Android devices default to 5G or 4G LTE for mobile data, but those networks may not be as expansive as your carrier’s 3G or even 2G network (<a class="link"   href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-beginners-guide-to-recording-video-calls-with-google-meets/" >if they still have one <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can try downgrading to 3G to see if there’s reception.</p><p> You’ll need to navigate to the settings for your SIM card. Depending on your device, this may be found at Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile Networks, or Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; SIMs. Look for “Network Mode” or “Preferred Network” and change it to 3G.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240227-162848.png"                      alt="Android Preferred Network Type."                > </p><h3 id="Reset-Network-Settings"><a href="#Reset-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Network Settings"></a>Reset Network Settings</h3><p> You probably know that you can perform a factory reset to wipe your phone completely, but you don’t need to go that extreme here. Android also allows you to reset only the network settings.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cross-language-chatgpt-usage-simplified/" >On a Samsung Galaxy phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, go to Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reset-network-settings-android-samsung.png"                      alt="Reset network settings on Samsung."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-smart-speaker-for-melody-lovers-the-nest-audio-assessment/" >On a Google Pixel phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Reset Options &gt; Reset Mobile Network Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240227-161722.png"                      alt="Google Pixel Reset Mobile Network Settings."                > </p><h3 id="Restart-Your-Phone"><a href="#Restart-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Restart Your Phone"></a>Restart Your Phone</h3><p> Here’s a simple thing you can do that will solve a surprising number of problems: restart your phone. Sounds easy, but it’s effective. Typically, you can long-press the power button and select “Reboot” from the menu. However, more and more Android phones have changed this behavior to launch the digital assistant, <a class="link"   href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-apple-iphone-8-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >so check out our full guide for more restart options. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-and-Force-Stop-the-SIM-Toolkit-App"><a href="#Clear-Cache-and-Force-Stop-the-SIM-Toolkit-App" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache and Force Stop the SIM Toolkit App"></a>Clear Cache and Force Stop the SIM Toolkit App</h3><p> If all else has failed, there’s one last thing we can try before <a class="link"   href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-get-the-apple-id-verification-code-from-apple-iphone-14-in-the-best-ways-by-drfone-ios/" >resorting to a full factory reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s a system app on all Android devices called “SIM Toolkit.” Clearing the app’s cache and restarting may resolve some issues. This is not an app you’ll see in the app drawer, but it can be found in the Settings.</p><p> Open the Settings app on your phone and navigate to the “Apps” section. You’ll need to expand the full list of apps if it’s not shown by default, and select “Show System” from the menu to see all apps installed on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240228-163745.png"                      alt="See all system apps on Android."                > </p><p> Scroll down and find the “SIM Toolkit” app. Now, <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-apeak-recorder-reviewed-speed-quality-and-ease-of-use-scored/" >clear the cache <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and force restart the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_20240228-163853.png"                      alt="Android SIM Toolkit app."                > </p><hr><p> The good news is the “Emergency Calls Only” error typically doesn’t require complicated fixes to resolve.

One of my complaints about the keyboard cover was the lackluster trackpad gestures and key layout. I know Android isn’t a desktop OS, but you expect things to work a certain way when you have a full-size keyboard and trackpad.</p><p> A bunch of new keyboard and trackpad enhancements were <a class="link"   href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-improved-keyboard-support/?newsletter_popup=1" >discovered in early Android 14 builds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It may include the ability to customize the Caps Lock, Ctrl, Alt, and Meta keys. Some of the keycodes were also changed to work better with Android’s navigation, and there looks to be support for media control and adjusting keyboard backlighting.</p><p> On the trackpad side of things, it appears there will be new settings for the direction of scrolling, tap-to-click behavior, pointer speed, and gestures. Some of this is stuff that manufacturers have worked out themselves, but it will be nice to have it baked in to Android.</p><h2 id="Easily-Use-Your-Phone-as-a-Webcam"><a href="#Easily-Use-Your-Phone-as-a-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Easily Use Your Phone as a Webcam"></a>Easily Use Your Phone as a Webcam</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG20230609162313-1.jpg"                      alt="Android phone as webcam"                > </p><p><em>Joe Fedewa &#x2F; How-To Geek</em></p><p> Hot on the trails of Apple making it possible to <a class="link"   href="https://dvd-bd.techidaily.com/diy-tutorial-transform-your-mp4-videos-into-a-professional-costless-dvd-with-ease/" >use iPhones as webcams <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2022, Android 14 may be doing the same thing.

Hopefully, this means more apps will use the system share menu. Also, the share menu is part of the Android OS, which means Google can only tweak it with full system updates. Android 14 may see the share menu get <a class="link"   href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-could-bring-a-more-consistent-share-menu/" >split out for much easier updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, thanks in large part to the Apple AirTag, people want to be able to track more than their phones. Google revamped the “Find My Device” service in response—here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-Find-My-Device-Network"><a href="#What-Is-the-Find-My-Device-Network" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Find My Device Network?"></a>What Is the Find My Device Network?</h2><p> Google’s “Find My Device” network is essentially Android’s version of Apple’s “Find My” network—big surprise. It allows you to locate missing accessories that you’ve set up with your Google account. The general idea is you can open the <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003802/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm&hl=en_US" >Android app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and see a list of your devices and where they are on a map.</p><p> It should be noted that there’s a difference between “Find My Device” and the “Find My Device <em>Network</em>.” Google has long had a <a class="link"   href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/crafting-stunning-photography-mastering-hdr-merging-in-lightroom/" >“Find My Device” service for phones, tablets, and smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It allows you to see their location on a map and remotely make the ring, lock the screen, or factory reset. This typically relies on the device being powered on and connected to the internet.</p><p>Close </p><p> Devices can be marked as “lost,” which will allow you to leave a phone number, email address, and a message on the lock screen. If the device doesn’t have a lock screen, someone can see the information by holding it to the back of their phone oir tablet. When a device is marked as lost, you get notified when its location has been detected.</p><p> You can also share devices with other people. For example, imagine you have a tracker placed in a backpack. You could share Find My Device access with your partner so you can both keep tabs on it while on a trip. The Find My Device network will also notify you if an unknown tracker appears to be following you, which is something <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-comprehensive-guide-to-digital-subtitle-enhancing-platforms/" >Google and Apple are working on together <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="It-Uses-Crowdsourcing-to-Find-Devices"><a href="#It-Uses-Crowdsourcing-to-Find-Devices" class="headerlink" title="It Uses Crowdsourcing to Find Devices"></a>It Uses Crowdsourcing to Find Devices</h2><p> “Find My Device” is the entire product, but the “Find My Device <em>Network</em>“ is one way in which you can actually find your lost devices. It’s all about crowdsourcing, and it’s particularly important for Bluetooth trackers that don’t have their own internet connections to rely on.</p><p> By default, every Android device is opted into Google’s Find My Device network—the same way that Apple’s Find My network operates. Let’s say you have a <a class="link"   href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card-point?variant=1076044" >Chipolo CARD Point <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your wallet, and you left it behind somewhere. When you mark it as “lost,” nearby Android devices in the Find My Device Network will detect the tracker, and the location will be reported back to you.</p><p> That’s how it can help <em>you</em>, but, of course, it goes both ways—your Android device can also help others. Here’s what Google says about the <a class="link"   href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html" >privacy of your location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when used to locate devices.</p><blockquote><p>Your devices’ locations will be encrypted using the PIN, pattern, or password for your Android devices. They can only be seen by you and those you share your devices within Find My Device.

It’s flashy in its lime-green color, but it’s just a battery. It can provide up to 16 hours of additional power with its 5,000mAh internal battery. When out and about, it can recharge an iPhone at 7.5W, but when plugged in, it can provide the full 15W Qi2 speed.</p><p> That means it can power your phone at a decent speed on the train, but when back at the hotel and plugged in, it can power it even faster at MagSafe’s top pace. It would be nice to have something faster than 7.5W while on the go, but really, anything above 5W is a win. The Qi2 spec means the power bank can have a life beyond iPhones too, when Android phones get around to adding the feature.</p><p> Beyond the Qi2 differentiator, the other thing that makes it incredibly useful is the flip-out kickstand. Typically I’m watching a baseball game or some other video when my iPhone could use a boost of power. This solves the problem of keeping the phone propped up without adding any bulk. It’s useful enough just as a stand that it’s not dead weight even after its power is gone.</p><p> Importantly, The BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K is lightweight enough not to be noticeable in my bag. I don’t have to decide how important the emergency power supply is for my trip. It’s not going to weigh me down. It is heavier than the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack, but only by an ounce.</p><p>Close </p><p> While not critical to the experience of using the Belkin battery, I do like the colors that it comes in. The lime color pops in person and the blue looks fresh. I’m a fan. I also like how Belkin includes a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box. A nicety that’s no longer guaranteed.</p><p> The USB-C cable not only serves as a way to recharge the Power Bank 5K when it’s depleted, but it can charge other non-Qi devices too. The BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K isn’t only my phone’s backup battery, but it also recharges my X100VI camera, earbuds, Bluetooth speaker, iPad, and other things that get drained while traveling.</p><p> I’ve also tried Belkin’s bigger Qi2 <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRE52ZM/A/belkin-boostcharge-pro-magnetic-charging-power-bank-10k-cable" >BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 10K + Cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which has twice the battery, faster on-the-go charging, and a built-in USB-C cable. It’s fantastic if you need even longer battery life. I always opt for the smaller and lighter option though, so the 5K version is the one in my travel bag.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Belkin-BoostCharge-Pro-Power-Bank-5K"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Belkin-BoostCharge-Pro-Power-Bank-5K" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K?"></a>Should You Buy the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/person-holding-the-belkin-boostcharge-pro-power-bank-5k.jpg"                      alt="Person holding the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> There are a lot of phone batteries out there but the reason the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRGJ2ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2-pro-magnetic-power-bank-5k-magsafe-compatible" >BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has found a place in my small pouch of cables is because it melds a few key features together. It’s thin, lightweight, powerful, and has a handy kickstand.</p><p> I tend to prioritize minimal efficiency over any kind of overly complex solution.

I’d argue there might be too many choices, but the latest entry is a small option. In design, it competes against Kobo and Kindle e-readers. In price, it competes against an iPad mini.</p><p> By all accounts, the specs indicate a full-featured Android tablet. In my use, the Tab Mini C felt speedy, at least as nimble as its E-Ink refresh rates would allow. The momentary delay when scrolling or tapping is simply the current trade-off for staring at a screen that appears more analog than digital.</p><p> Reading emails, books, and long-form articles were all very manageable on the device. Browsing websites and using other apps that require a lot of swiping or finger-poking felt more limiting, especially in direct comparison to using a phone screen.</p><p> I found the Tab Mini C excelled when using it as an e-reader rather than a general-purpose tablet. Its flexibility to run Android apps, however, meant I could use whatever book-reading app I wanted, or I could navigate to a website and read a 10,000-word story without fatiguing my eyes.</p><p> There is no keyboard cover available for the Tab Mini C like there is for the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/chucklecraft-suite-for-2024/" >Tab Ultra C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The device still has the power to function as a word processor, but I didn’t care for connecting a Bluetooth keyboard and using it that way.</p><p> Comparatively, I found typing on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/155223/remarkable-2-review/" >reMarkable 2 with its Type Folio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to be a better experience for e-paper devices if you do really want to go down that path. There are a host of compromises with the Tab Mini C, but overall, I had very few complaints about using it to read books.</p><h2 id="The-Tab-Mini-C-Case-and-Stylus"><a href="#The-Tab-Mini-C-Case-and-Stylus" class="headerlink" title="The Tab Mini C Case and Stylus"></a>The Tab Mini C Case and Stylus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/976ef165-9b89-45d5-bbe4-c75173d39349-1.JPG"                      alt="Boox Tab Mini C in its included cover with magnetic flap"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> I loved the included magnetic case that comes with the Tab Mini C, and I hated it too. The actual folio part that wraps around the front and the back felt squishy and smooth with a hint of tacky grip. I loved holding it and didn’t want to take it off. But at the same time, folding the cover back presented a dangling flap that was distracting while reading and didn’t seem as magnetic as it could have been.</p><p> The magnetic flap closure is there, mostly, to keep the stylus attached to the side of the device. But the stylus was also annoying to keep attached while reading.</p><p> I found the stylus to be a double-edged sword. It was great for handwriting notes, which made me want to keep it attached, but I didn’t feel like I naturally took enough notes to justify carrying it all the time.</p><p> The Boox Notes app had enough features with things like AI recognition of handwritten text to make it useful for anyone who wants to spend time using it. I find the same thing true of the Apple Pencil. It has always worked well on supported iPads, but I personally don’t use it enough to keep it permanently attached to the side.</p><h2 id="Comparing-Boox-Nova-C-to-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Comparing-Boox-Nova-C-to-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Boox Nova C to Tab Mini C"></a>Comparing Boox Nova C to Tab Mini C</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/168cf678-165f-4f32-b12e-1dfc0932096e-1.JPG"                      alt="Showing Boox Tab Mini C with the book cover of Tristan Strong Keeps Punching"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The color display was a stand-out feature of the Tab Mini C. It made all kinds of tablet tasks more palatable on an e-paper display. Even reading and being able to highlight in color was a surprise realization. The problem is that the color screen is not unique to this device. Boox has a number of products with similar displays, including the comparably sized <a class="link"   href="https://shop.boox.com/products/novaairc" >Nova Air C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reader.</p><p> Here are the primary differences between the Tab Mini C and the Nova Air C.</p><ul><li>5000mAh Battery on Tab Mini C vs. 2000mAh Battery on Nova Air C</li><li>Octa-core CPU and exclusive GPU on Tab Mini C vs. Octa-core CPU on Nova Air C</li><li>300ppi black and white and 150ppi color on Tab Mini C vs. 300ppi black and white and 100ppi color on Nova Air C</li><li>7.8-inch Kaleido 3 color e-paper screen on Tab Mini C vs. 7.8-inch Kaleido Plus color e-paper Screen on Nova Air C</li></ul><p> The Tab Mini C does have more RAM and storage, but ultimately it felt like both were more similar than they were different. I did notice the slightly more vibrant colors from denser pixels per inch on the Tab Mini C and the longer battery life. It was debatable whether those two specific items were worth the $50 over Nova Air C’s current $399 retail price.</p><p> Frankly, the battery life of all Boox e-paper devices has been excellent. In this case, I was able to go more than a week with plenty of daily reading before thinking about charging the Tab Mini C. The best part is the device’s standby time which can last months if you forget about it or don’t need it.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Boox-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Boox-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Boox Tab Mini C?"></a>Should You Buy the Boox Tab Mini C?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7875da36-c388-414b-b869-995b049f45cc-1.JPG"                      alt="Boox Tab Mini C showing the howtogeek.com website"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> For all its features and specs, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Mini-Tablet-ePaper/dp/B0C6TQ5JH7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904519&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/boox-tab-mini-c-review/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >Boox Tab Mini C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is, really, only a powerful e-reader. People shopping for a device to read books will be satisfied with the Tab Mini C’s ability to access Kindle books, digital library books, and Google Books, along with PDFs and other reading material. Its dash of color was helpful across the board and made browsing digital bookstores more enjoyable, too.</p><p> The reasons to avoid the Tab Mini C have less to do with function and more to do with price. Its cost proximity to the Boox Nova C and the Tab Ultra C only makes cases for buying those other devices, rather than this one.</p><p> The Tab Mini C is a fine product for being a multitasking reader, but it’s just not a good value. It’s much better than a low-cost Kindle, but most people might not even appreciate all of its benefits. The Tab Mini C also gets stuck in the middle of Boox’s product line, not to mention competition from the iPad mini, which starts at the same $450 price. It’s a solid product hindered by its technology’s expense.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/my-project.png"                      alt="My project"                > </p><h5 id="Boox-Tab-Mini-C-1"><a href="#Boox-Tab-Mini-C-1" class="headerlink" title="Boox Tab Mini C"></a>Boox Tab Mini C</h5><p>6&#x2F; 10 </p><p>Boox Tab Mini C is an Android tablet with an E-Ink display.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Mini-Tablet-ePaper/dp/B0C6TQ5JH7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904519&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/boox-tab-mini-c-review/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop.boox.com/products/tabminic/" >$450 at Boox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1773404-REG/boox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5F7%5F8%5Fe%5Fink%5Ftablet.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU904519" >$450 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Select-an-Ideal-Keyboard-Attachment-for-Your-Steam-Deck-Ownership-Journey"><a href="#How-to-Select-an-Ideal-Keyboard-Attachment-for-Your-Steam-Deck-Ownership-Journey" class="headerlink" title="How to Select an Ideal Keyboard Attachment for Your Steam Deck Ownership Journey"></a>How to Select an Ideal Keyboard Attachment for Your Steam Deck Ownership Journey</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Stick to Bluetooth and keyboards with 2.4GHz connectivity to avoid cumbersome wired connections.</li><li>Foldable keyboards are ideal for travelers looking for space-saving options with wireless connectivity.</li><li>If you don’t like the prospect of a foldable keyboard, consider compact, low-profile keyboards that neatly compliment your Steam Deck’s footprint.</li></ul><p> While the Steam Deck is the closest we’ve got to a gaming console out of all handheld PCs, I recommend grabbing a keyboard if you plan to venture out into Desktop Mode or use your Deck docked. Here’s how to pick one, along with a few recommendations if you don’t feel like window shopping online.</p><h2 id="Bluetooth-Connectivity-Is-A-Must"><a href="#Bluetooth-Connectivity-Is-A-Must" class="headerlink" title="Bluetooth Connectivity Is A Must"></a>Bluetooth Connectivity Is A Must</h2><p> First and foremost, make sure to get a Bluetooth keyboard, or one that supports 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, because having to hook a wired keyboard to your Deck every time you want to type something is not only a huge pain, but also requires a USB-C dock since the Deck only has a single USB-C port.</p><p> Connecting a wired keyboard when docked is an even bigger hassle, especially if you keep your dock next to your TV. I strongly advise every Steam Deck owner to go down the Bluetooth route.</p><p> While not perfect and with <a class="link"   href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-ditch-subtitle-edit-explore-these-exceptional-mac-subtitle-editors/" >a higher amount of latency <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compared to the cable and 2.4G, Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and fast enough for both light and long typing sessions, as well as for playing most single-player games.</p><p> Those of you who want to play multiplayer games on your Deck, or titles that require as little latency as possible, such as rhythm games, should aim for a keyboard that supports 2.4GHz wireless connectivity instead. That’s because 2.4GHz offers higher reliability and lower latency than Bluetooth.</p><p> While Bluetooth also uses 2.4Ghz radio frequencies, I’m using “2.4Ghz” here as a catch-all for the proprietary wireless technologies used by mouse and keyboard manufacturers, such as Logitech’s Unifying Receiver system.</p><h2 id="A-Foldable-Keyboard-Is-Great-for-Steam-Deck-Owners-Who-Are-Constantly-on-the-Move"><a href="#A-Foldable-Keyboard-Is-Great-for-Steam-Deck-Owners-Who-Are-Constantly-on-the-Move" class="headerlink" title="A Foldable Keyboard Is Great for Steam Deck Owners Who Are Constantly on the Move"></a>A Foldable Keyboard Is Great for Steam Deck Owners Who Are Constantly on the Move</h2><p> If you’re a frequent traveler and want a keyboard that won’t take up lots of space in your bag, check out foldable keyboards. They aren’t the greatest choice for typing and gaming due to their design, but they take much less space than even 60% keyboards, most models are super affordable, and virtually every foldable keyboard supports wireless connectivity.</p><p> A foldable keyboard is also a great choice for Steam Deck owners looking for a super-compact and affordable keyboard which they can tuck away in a drawer and take out for an occasional excursion into Desktop Mode to install a new game launcher such as the <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-future-of-tv-watching-a-closer-look-at-youtube-tv/" >Epic Games Launcher <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, install and configure emulators, or just have it lying around while using their Deck docked.</p><h2 id="If-a-Foldable-Keyboard-Doesn’t-fit-the-Bill-Get-Something-Compact-and-Low-Profile"><a href="#If-a-Foldable-Keyboard-Doesn’t-fit-the-Bill-Get-Something-Compact-and-Low-Profile" class="headerlink" title="If a Foldable Keyboard Doesn’t fit the Bill, Get Something Compact and Low-Profile"></a>If a Foldable Keyboard Doesn’t fit the Bill, Get Something Compact and Low-Profile</h2><p> If you don’t like foldable keyboards and want something that’s made for heavy typing, stick to compact and preferably low-profile keyboards. The market is teeming with excellent compact, low-profile keyboards, many of which are mechanical and&#x2F;or relatively affordable, offering a great typing and gaming experience.</p><p> Compact form factors—I’m talking about 75% and smaller—neatly complement the Deck’s footprint, making them great for travel. Besides, TKL (<a class="link"   href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/logitech-g502-gaming-mouse-troubleshooting-and-updating-drivers-made-simple/" >Tenkeyless <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and full-sized keyboards take up a ton of space, especially if we’re talking about mechanical keyboards.</p><p> If you need a keyboard for typing and easier navigation around Desktop Mode, a great option would be a compact, low-profile keyboard with a built-in touchpad.

To maximize your hard drive’s longevity, keep the following factors in mind.</p><h2 id="Choose-a-Reliable-Manufacturer"><a href="#Choose-a-Reliable-Manufacturer" class="headerlink" title="Choose a Reliable Manufacturer"></a>Choose a Reliable Manufacturer</h2><p> If your hard drive has an electronic or mechanical manufacturing defect, it likely won’t last long. Therefore, it’s important to choose a reliable manufacturer when purchasing a hard drive. Reputable brands have rigorous quality control processes, reducing the likelihood of defects that could cause early failure.</p><p> Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital are some of the most well-known HDD manufacturers. Check out <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-secrets-to-preventing-blank-scenes-with-obs-recording/" >our recommended HDDs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> whether you’re looking for a drive that balances price with performance, offers higher speed, or fits within a limited budget. Also, make sure the drive comes with a warranty! While a warranty won’t extend the drive’s lifespan, it provides peace of mind that you’ll get a replacement if the drive fails within the first few months.</p><h2 id="Handle-Your-Hard-Drive-With-Care"><a href="#Handle-Your-Hard-Drive-With-Care" class="headerlink" title="Handle Your Hard Drive With Care"></a>Handle Your Hard Drive With Care</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/seagate-internal-hard-drive.jpg"                      alt="Man holding an internal hard drive in his hand."                > </p><p>Jordan Gloor &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Dropping your hard drive can severely damage it. The impact can cause the read&#x2F;write head to crash onto the spinning platters, scratching or damaging them. It can also misalign components, bend or break the read&#x2F;write head, damage the spinning motor, and, in severe cases, loosen internal connections and circuitry.</p><p> Therefore, it’s crucial to handle external hard drives with care and avoid dropping your laptop to protect internal drives. Additionally, one common reason for hard drives arriving faulty is mishandling by the shipping carrier. If you’re buying a hard drive online, ensure you choose a reliable carrier known for properly handling electronics.</p><h2 id="Avoid-Exposure-to-Static-Electricity"><a href="#Avoid-Exposure-to-Static-Electricity" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Exposure to Static Electricity"></a>Avoid Exposure to Static Electricity</h2><p> Always protect your hard drive from static electricity, as static discharge can damage sensitive electronic components. When repairing or disassembling the hard drive, you should always wear a <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-reviewing-ingenuity-moto-z2s-intelligent-evolution/" >grounded anti-static wrist strap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to prevent static buildup on your body from discharging into the drive.</p><p> Avoid placing the drive on synthetic materials or clothing that can generate static electricity. Using an anti-static mat is even better. Also, don’t touch the circuit board or electronic components; hold the drive by its edges to minimize the risk. These precautions are especially crucial when handling external drives.</p><p> When storing unused or external hard drives, use an anti-static bag to protect them from static charges.</p><h2 id="Always-Eject-Your-Hard-Drive-Before-Unplugging"><a href="#Always-Eject-Your-Hard-Drive-Before-Unplugging" class="headerlink" title="Always Eject Your Hard Drive Before Unplugging"></a>Always Eject Your Hard Drive Before Unplugging</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/win10_safe_to_remove_message.jpg"                      alt="A &quot;Safe to Remove Hardware&quot; notification in Windows 10."                > </p><p>Benj Edwards &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> If you frequently use an external hard drive, always remember to eject it before unplugging. This practice not only prevents data loss but also ensures that the drive properly parks the read&#x2F;write head, preventing head crashes. This also ensures the drive is not actively spinning or engaged in read&#x2F;write operations when you unplug it.</p><p> Moreover, ejecting allows the operating system to safely unmount the drive and stabilize other moving parts, like the spindle motor in HDDs. Abrupt disconnection can also lead to voltage fluctuations, electrical spikes, or surges due to the sudden interruption in the circuit, which can also potentially damage the drive circuitry.</p><p> Because of these reasons, it is important to always eject the drive before disconnecting it. Learn how to <a class="link"   href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-comprehensive-review-analyzing-androids-lightroom/" >safely eject a drive on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-ions-pro-3-action-camera-capabilities/" >macOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Invest-in-a-High-Quality-Power-Supply-Unit"><a href="#Invest-in-a-High-Quality-Power-Supply-Unit" class="headerlink" title="Invest in a High-Quality Power Supply Unit"></a>Invest in a High-Quality Power Supply Unit</h2><p> While hard drives include built-in protection against power surges and voltage fluctuations, they can only withstand brief changes in power and voltage supply. Prolonged or severe power surges or voltage changes can still cause significant damage. Therefore, it is important to use a high-quality PSU (Power Supply Unit).</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/youtubes-buzzing-titles-roundup-1-8/" >High-quality PSUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from reputable manufacturers provide stable power.

However, not all of these methods are secure as others.</p><p> For example, the face unlock on many Android devices <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-can-i-use-a-fake-gps-without-mock-location-on-vivo-v29-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >is surprisingly easy to fool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You may also have some Bluetooth devices that unlock the phone. The most secure Android unlocking methods are the PIN, pattern, and password.</p><p> When you put the phone into “Lockdown,” it disables all those less-secure unlock methods.

Motorola and Xiaomi also just revealed new foldable phones, giving Samsung a run for its money.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/33918/heres-what-motorola-wants-you-to-know-about-the-razrs-folding-screen/" >Motorola already had a Razr-branded folding phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, inspired by the design of the early-2000s Razr flip phones, but the company has been slow to update it. Nearly two years after the last model, Motorola has revealed the Razr 2022. It’s exclusive to China, at least for now, but it’s much closer to competing with Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/30afca00-1948-11ed-afff-0cf14a2081b5.jpeg"                      alt="Motorola Razr 2022 front and back"                > </p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://chinese.engadget.com/moto-razr-2022-x30-pro-s30-pro-074004493.html" >Motorola &#x2F; Engadget Chinese <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p> The new Razr has the same <a class="link"   href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-storytelling-methodologies-for-the-documentarian/" >Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Fold 4, paired with a 6.7-inch main OLED screen. Just like with the Z Flip (and many other folding phones), there’s also a small display on the outside (below the cameras), which can be used for taking photos, checking notifications, and other functions without opening the phone. There’s a 32 MP front-facing camera, a 50 MP main lens, and a 13 MP ultra-wide – on paper, that’s more impressive than the cameras on the Flip 4.</p><p> Xiaomi also just revealed a new folding phone, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.mi.com/xiaomimixfold2" >Mix Fold 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The phone has the same book-like design as the Galaxy Z Fold, with a super-thin design and the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip. It’s also exclusive to China for the moment, but it looks like one of the best foldable devices yet – Xiaomi integrated 67W fast charging, 120Hz support on both the interior and exterior screens, and triple rear cameras.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Xiaomi-Mix-phone.jpg"                      alt="Xiaomi MIX Fold 2 opened"                > </p><p>The Xiaomi MIX Fold 2</p><p> Even though neither phone will be immediately available in the United States – the Razr has a chance of showing up in the US, at least – the new devices are serious competition for Samsung in other countries. Motorola had some catching up to do, since it didn’t release a new Razr at all last year, but this is Xiaomi’s second year in a row delivering a premium folding phone. If Samsung wants to remain competitive in the rapidly-emerging foldable phones market, it may have to work on more serious improvements for its Fold and Flip devices.</p><p> Source: Engadget (<a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-leica-pricing-availability-124434422.html" >Xiaomi Mix Fold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/motos-folding-razr-2022-finally-packs-a-flagship-processor-085914570.html" >Moto Razr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It does so without prompting you first and it can get pretty annoying. There’s no obvious way to stop this “feature” either. But there are workarounds.</p><h2 id="When-Bluetooth-Gets-On-Your-Nerves"><a href="#When-Bluetooth-Gets-On-Your-Nerves" class="headerlink" title="When Bluetooth Gets On Your Nerves"></a>When Bluetooth Gets On Your Nerves</h2><p> To me, auto-connect and autoplay are bugs more than features. You would think that auto-connect wouldn’t connect to another device while you’re on a call or playing audio. At least <em>request</em> if you’d like to switch <a class="link"   href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insta-to-tik-integration-masterclass/" >Bluetooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>devices, right? But that’s not the case.</p><p> If my phone is connected to my headphones and I walk into a room with a <a class="link"   href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/mastering-server-connection-resets-for-a-flawless-destiny-2-gaming-experience/" >paired Bluetooth speaker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the audio will jump to that speaker for no reason and without warning. The same thing happens when I’m in the car. Bluetooth just automatically connects to the stereo without a prompt. Even <a class="link"   href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-oppo-find-x6-by-drfone-android/" >turning Bluetooth off and on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> doesn’t work every time. There’s no telling what device the auto-connect is going to take over next. For a long time, I put up with it by just unpairing Bluetooth devices and pairing them again when I needed to switch.</p><p> The issue can be easily fixed if developers add a dedicated auto-connect switch next to every paired device. I couldn’t find any settings (hidden or otherwise) that disable Bluetooth auto-connect. But I did figure out a workaround that does the job using Android’s Developer Options. You don’t need a third-party app for it—just the Settings app on your Android device will do.</p><p> Alternatively, you can create a simple automated routine to keep devices from auto-connecting to your Android while it’s playing audio. I’ll show you how to do that using the MacroDroid app.</p><h2 id="How-to-Disable-Bluetooth-Autoconnect-on-Android"><a href="#How-to-Disable-Bluetooth-Autoconnect-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Disable Bluetooth Autoconnect on Android"></a>How to Disable Bluetooth Autoconnect on Android</h2><p> Sadly, the setting we need to disable Bluetooth auto-connect is hidden by default. <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-decode-your-youtube-preferences-with-these-6-fan-favorite-questionnaires/" >Developer Options are a bunch of hidden Android settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allow developers to test and debug their apps. As such, they give you greater control over your device settings than the regular Settings app.</p><p> The title and location of the developer options vary between manufacturers. <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/premium-video-capture-without-extras-for-2024/" >Check out our full walkthrough to enable Developer Options <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When you’re done, open the main settings page and scroll all the way down to find Developer Options. Sometimes, they’re tucked away under “Additional Settings,” too.</p><p> Open Developer Options and scroll down to the section with all the Bluetooth options.</p><p>Close </p><p> We don’t need to worry about all the technical options because we only want to change a single setting. Tap “Maximum Connected Bluetooth Devices.” The system default is “5,” but you should change it to “1.” That’s it.</p><p> It’s rare, but some old phones even have a dedicated Bluetooth auto-connect toggle in the Developer Options, but it won’t be available on most devices.</p><p> After you’re done, you have to <a class="link"   href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-apple-iphone-8-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >restart your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it should stop auto-connecting.</p><h2 id="Set-Up-Automation-to-Stop-Bluetooth-Auto-connect"><a href="#Set-Up-Automation-to-Stop-Bluetooth-Auto-connect" class="headerlink" title="Set Up Automation to Stop Bluetooth Auto-connect"></a>Set Up Automation to Stop Bluetooth Auto-connect</h2><p> If the “Maximum Connected Bluetooth Devices” is grayed out in your Developer Options (sometimes it is, depending on the manufacturer), you can try setting up a routine that disables auto-connect for specific paired devices.</p><p> To create an automated routine, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sleepy-sequences-examining-bedtime-story-video-adaptations/" >Bixby Routines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (if you’re using a Samsung) or a third party app like Marodroid or <a class="link"   href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/avchd-on-motorola-moto-g14-convert-mts-for-motorola-moto-g14-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mts-on-android/" >Tasker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I’m using Macrodroid for this demonstration. But you can implement the logic in any automation app: when a specific device connects via Bluetooth, disconnect that device if playback is active.</p><p> The routine will keep disconnecting any device that tries to connect while playback is active automatically.</p><p> Install <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003839/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid&hl=en" >MacroDroid from the Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tap through the first setup.</p><p>Close </p><p> Turn off battery optimization for the MacroDroid app to make sure Android won’t kill the app while it’s running in the background.</p><p> On the MacroDroid home page, tap “New Macro” and select “Trigger” (tap the plus icon on the Triggers bar). Expand “Connectivity” and tap “Bluetooth Event.” Pick “Device Connected” from the options and tap “OK.”</p><p>Close </p><p> MacroDroid will ask permission to turn Bluetooth on and show a list of paired devices. Here, pick the Bluetooth device you want to keep from auto-connecting. And tap “OK.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot_2024-06-26-21-43-05-921_com-arlosoft-macrodroid.jpg"                      alt="Selecting the Bluetooth device to trigger."                > </p><p> Now that we’ve set the trigger, we just have to bind it to an action. Tap the plus icon on the “Actions” bar. Expand “Connectivity” and tap the “Bluetooth Configure” button. Select “Disconnect Audio Device” and tap “OK.” Once again, pick the device you want to keep from connecting and tap “OK.”</p><p>Close </p><p> Repeat the same steps for your other paired devices (you can create multiple triggers and actions using the plus buttons).</p><p> Finally, we’ll add a constraint that only triggers this routine when your phone is playing media. That way, you’ll never have to worry about your audio jumping between Bluetooth devices. To add a constraint, tap the plus icon on the Constraints bar and expand the “Media” section. Select “Music Active,” then “Music Playing,” and hit “OK.”</p><p>Close </p><p> Give your macro a name and tap “Test” from the three-dot menu to check if it’s working fine. You’ll see the newly created macro under the Macros tab.</p><hr><p> Until developers officially ship Android with an option to disable Bluetooth disconnect, you can automate the process or restrict the number of connected devices.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-AMD’s-Advanced-Artificial-Intelligence-Chip-in-New-ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-G16-Laptop"><a href="#Unveiling-AMD’s-Advanced-Artificial-Intelligence-Chip-in-New-ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-G16-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling AMD’s Advanced Artificial Intelligence Chip in New ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 Laptop"></a>Unveiling AMD’s Advanced Artificial Intelligence Chip in New ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 Laptop</h2><p>The ASUS Zephyrus series stands out from the crowd of PC laptops with its high-end hardware, sleek and thin design, and great gaming performance. There’s now a new model on the way with new AMD hardware and the same great design.</p><p> ASUS just announced an updated ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptop (model GA605). The company already <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-manual-pinning-people-on-snapchat/" >resigned the laptop earlier this year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review/" >reviews for the latest model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are generally positive. ASUS is releasing another model with AMD Ryzen AI HX 370 processor, swapping out the Intel Core Ultra chips found in the existing G16. It will ship with up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.</p><p> The new AMD processor has 12 cores, 24 threads, and a built-in NPU capable of 50 TOPS for AI workloads. That’s one of the <a class="link"   href="https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-infinix-smart-8-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/" >Zen 5 processors that AMD just announced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Combined with an RTX 4070 graphics card, you get a total of 402 TOPs of AI processing power for <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-infinix-smart-8-pro-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/" >running local AI models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The Zephryus 16 is designed for more demanding productivity work, such as photo and video editing, as well as PC gaming. The dedicated graphics card can also come in handy for AI workloads, but the Ryzen CPU is supposed to be handle some of that on its own. You also get the same excellent OLED panel as the existing model, and it’s the first ASUS ROG laptop to support Wi-Fi 7.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/off-center-shot-of-the-front-of-the-zephyrus-g16-in-eclipse-grey-with-the-rog-fearless-eye-logo-on-screen.jpeg"                      alt="Black ASUS gaming laptop with a thin design, from a side angle."                > </p><p>ASUS</p><p> ASUS said in a press release, “This new AMD platform is packed in the same thin-and-light design that made waves at CES 2024, with an exquisitely crafted CNC-milled aluminum chassis, with a customizable Slash Lighting array on the lid. It also features an ROG Nebula display with an OLED panel that supports NVIDIA G-SYNC®. Its 16:10 aspect ratio, 2.5K resolution, and 240 Hz refresh rate are perfect for gaming and content creation alike, with VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 certification for excellent HDR experiences.”</p><p> The ROG Zephyrus G16 will be available in two hardware configurations from the ASUS online store and other retailers, in both ‘Platinum White’ and ‘Eclipse Gray’ colors. ASUS has not yet confirmed pricing in the United States.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-ga605-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-nvidia-rtx-4070/" >ASUS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

No more settling for generic visuals; the app allows you to choose specific areas, cities, or countries to feature on your live map wallpaper. It’s like curating your own digital map gallery that reflects your favorite places.</p><p> Cartogram also brings a touch of realism with its day and night views feature. The maps adjust based on the time of day, providing a different visual experience, whether it’s morning, noon, or night.</p><p> Concerned about battery life? Well, live wallpapers do tend to consume more battery juice. However, Cartogram claims that it is battery-friendly, and in my case, the battery drain was not excessive, but your mileage may vary.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Now the final beta version has arrived, taking us one step closer to the completed update.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/plating-aesthetics-capturing-delectable-dishes-on-screen-for-2024/" >How to Install the Android 13 Beta on Your Phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Android 13 Beta 4 is <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/plating-aesthetics-capturing-delectable-dishes-on-screen-for-2024/" >now available for download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on select Google Pixel devices, which Google says is the last testing update before Android 13 is officially completed. The final stable update is “just a few weeks away,” and just like the other betas, the new Beta 4 update is mostly intended for developers who need to test apps and games on Android 13.</p><p> Much like last month’s <a class="link"   href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/the-10-best-tools-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-from-apple-iphone-12-mini-you-should-try-out-by-drfone-ios/" >Beta 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, this update doesn’t have any notable changes or new features. Google has been focused on fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities ahead of the final release.</p><p> Android 13 focuses on security and privacy enhancements, similar to Android 12 and 11. There’s a new runtime permission for notifications, so it’s easier for you to reject notifications from certain apps, and access to local files has been <a class="link"   href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions" >split across three new permissions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (representing images&#x2F;photos, video, and audio).

Most other companies aren’t as fast, so if previous releases are any indication, many phones and tablets could have to wait until later this year or sometime in 2023.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/" >Android Developers Blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

I’d argue there might be too many choices, but the latest entry is a small option. In design, it competes against Kobo and Kindle e-readers. In price, it competes against an iPad mini.</p><p> By all accounts, the specs indicate a full-featured Android tablet. In my use, the Tab Mini C felt speedy, at least as nimble as its E-Ink refresh rates would allow. The momentary delay when scrolling or tapping is simply the current trade-off for staring at a screen that appears more analog than digital.</p><p> Reading emails, books, and long-form articles were all very manageable on the device. Browsing websites and using other apps that require a lot of swiping or finger-poking felt more limiting, especially in direct comparison to using a phone screen.</p><p> I found the Tab Mini C excelled when using it as an e-reader rather than a general-purpose tablet. Its flexibility to run Android apps, however, meant I could use whatever book-reading app I wanted, or I could navigate to a website and read a 10,000-word story without fatiguing my eyes.</p><p> There is no keyboard cover available for the Tab Mini C like there is for the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/chucklecraft-suite-for-2024/" >Tab Ultra C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The device still has the power to function as a word processor, but I didn’t care for connecting a Bluetooth keyboard and using it that way.</p><p> Comparatively, I found typing on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/155223/remarkable-2-review/" >reMarkable 2 with its Type Folio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to be a better experience for e-paper devices if you do really want to go down that path. There are a host of compromises with the Tab Mini C, but overall, I had very few complaints about using it to read books.</p><h2 id="The-Tab-Mini-C-Case-and-Stylus"><a href="#The-Tab-Mini-C-Case-and-Stylus" class="headerlink" title="The Tab Mini C Case and Stylus"></a>The Tab Mini C Case and Stylus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/976ef165-9b89-45d5-bbe4-c75173d39349-1.JPG"                      alt="Boox Tab Mini C in its included cover with magnetic flap"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> I loved the included magnetic case that comes with the Tab Mini C, and I hated it too. The actual folio part that wraps around the front and the back felt squishy and smooth with a hint of tacky grip. I loved holding it and didn’t want to take it off. But at the same time, folding the cover back presented a dangling flap that was distracting while reading and didn’t seem as magnetic as it could have been.</p><p> The magnetic flap closure is there, mostly, to keep the stylus attached to the side of the device. But the stylus was also annoying to keep attached while reading.</p><p> I found the stylus to be a double-edged sword. It was great for handwriting notes, which made me want to keep it attached, but I didn’t feel like I naturally took enough notes to justify carrying it all the time.</p><p> The Boox Notes app had enough features with things like AI recognition of handwritten text to make it useful for anyone who wants to spend time using it. I find the same thing true of the Apple Pencil. It has always worked well on supported iPads, but I personally don’t use it enough to keep it permanently attached to the side.</p><h2 id="Comparing-Boox-Nova-C-to-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Comparing-Boox-Nova-C-to-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Boox Nova C to Tab Mini C"></a>Comparing Boox Nova C to Tab Mini C</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/168cf678-165f-4f32-b12e-1dfc0932096e-1.JPG"                      alt="Showing Boox Tab Mini C with the book cover of Tristan Strong Keeps Punching"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The color display was a stand-out feature of the Tab Mini C. It made all kinds of tablet tasks more palatable on an e-paper display. Even reading and being able to highlight in color was a surprise realization. The problem is that the color screen is not unique to this device. Boox has a number of products with similar displays, including the comparably sized <a class="link"   href="https://shop.boox.com/products/novaairc" >Nova Air C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reader.</p><p> Here are the primary differences between the Tab Mini C and the Nova Air C.</p><ul><li>5000mAh Battery on Tab Mini C vs. 2000mAh Battery on Nova Air C</li><li>Octa-core CPU and exclusive GPU on Tab Mini C vs. Octa-core CPU on Nova Air C</li><li>300ppi black and white and 150ppi color on Tab Mini C vs. 300ppi black and white and 100ppi color on Nova Air C</li><li>7.8-inch Kaleido 3 color e-paper screen on Tab Mini C vs. 7.8-inch Kaleido Plus color e-paper Screen on Nova Air C</li></ul><p> The Tab Mini C does have more RAM and storage, but ultimately it felt like both were more similar than they were different. I did notice the slightly more vibrant colors from denser pixels per inch on the Tab Mini C and the longer battery life. It was debatable whether those two specific items were worth the $50 over Nova Air C’s current $399 retail price.</p><p> Frankly, the battery life of all Boox e-paper devices has been excellent. In this case, I was able to go more than a week with plenty of daily reading before thinking about charging the Tab Mini C. The best part is the device’s standby time which can last months if you forget about it or don’t need it.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Boox-Tab-Mini-C"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Boox-Tab-Mini-C" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Boox Tab Mini C?"></a>Should You Buy the Boox Tab Mini C?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7875da36-c388-414b-b869-995b049f45cc-1.JPG"                      alt="Boox Tab Mini C showing the howtogeek.com website"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> For all its features and specs, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Mini-Tablet-ePaper/dp/B0C6TQ5JH7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904519&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/boox-tab-mini-c-review/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >Boox Tab Mini C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is, really, only a powerful e-reader. People shopping for a device to read books will be satisfied with the Tab Mini C’s ability to access Kindle books, digital library books, and Google Books, along with PDFs and other reading material. Its dash of color was helpful across the board and made browsing digital bookstores more enjoyable, too.</p><p> The reasons to avoid the Tab Mini C have less to do with function and more to do with price. Its cost proximity to the Boox Nova C and the Tab Ultra C only makes cases for buying those other devices, rather than this one.</p><p> The Tab Mini C is a fine product for being a multitasking reader, but it’s just not a good value. It’s much better than a low-cost Kindle, but most people might not even appreciate all of its benefits. The Tab Mini C also gets stuck in the middle of Boox’s product line, not to mention competition from the iPad mini, which starts at the same $450 price. It’s a solid product hindered by its technology’s expense.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/my-project.png"                      alt="My project"                > </p><h5 id="Boox-Tab-Mini-C-1"><a href="#Boox-Tab-Mini-C-1" class="headerlink" title="Boox Tab Mini C"></a>Boox Tab Mini C</h5><p>6&#x2F; 10 </p><p>Boox Tab Mini C is an Android tablet with an E-Ink display.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Mini-Tablet-ePaper/dp/B0C6TQ5JH7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904519&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/boox-tab-mini-c-review/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop.boox.com/products/tabminic/" >$450 at Boox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1773404-REG/boox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5F7%5F8%5Fe%5Fink%5Ftablet.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU904519" >$450 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The Exact Date for Samsung Unveils Galaxy S2"></a>Mark Your Calendars! The Exact Date for Samsung Unveils Galaxy S2</h2><p>Samsung is ramping up to announce the Galaxy S22 smartphone, and the company has sent <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unpacked-2022-1h-livestream-video/" >invitations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to everyone for a Galaxy Unpacked event on February 9, 2022, at 10 a.m. ET. Make sure you’re in front of your device if you want to see the future of the Samsung Galaxy brand.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/102380/samsung-galaxy-s22/" >kingdomrush07.jpg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> The invitation video features the number “22” and a large “S,” clearly pointing to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/102380/samsung-galaxy-s22/" >rumored Galaxy S22 smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s hard to imagine any other device being the event’s headliner based on the teaser in the video. That would certainly make sense, as tons of leaks have emerged regarding the Galaxy S22.</p><p> As far as what we know about the phone, there’s been no shortage of rumors about what it will bring to the table. A major point of speculation is the stylus. Almost every rumor has said there would be a slot for Samsung’s beloved S-Pen stylus, which brings it in line with the Note phones.</p><p> Interestingly, the Galaxy S22 is rumored to have a negligibly smaller 6.1-inch display compared to the S21’s 6.2-inch screen.</p><p> Outside of the screen and the S-Pen, there aren’t a lot of significant changes rumored. It’ll have better cameras and specs, but otherwise, it looks like Samsung will stick with the formula that has served it well.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
