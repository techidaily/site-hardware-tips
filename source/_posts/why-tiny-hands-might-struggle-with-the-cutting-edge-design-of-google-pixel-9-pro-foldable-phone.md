## Why Tiny Hands Might Struggle with the Cutting-Edge Design of Google Pixel 9 Pro Foldable Phone

A tablet that fits in your pocket—that's the sales pitch for foldable phones, yet it's usually an overstatement. Now, Google is appealing to foldable yay-sayers with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, a device that's roughly the size of an iPad Mini and packed to the gills with exceptionally premium hardware.

 Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the largest foldable smartphone to date. Its inner display measures 8 inches diagonal, a 5.25% increase over that of the [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instagrams-best-grids-built-by-the-top-tools-compiled-here/). The cover display is impressively large, too, clocking in at 6.3 inches (the same size as the standard Pixel 9 Pro).

 Evidently, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's broad size provides a bit of extra space for internal components. This isn't just the biggest foldable phone; it's also thinner than any other foldable, measuring just 5.1mm deep when splayed out in tablet mode. Bigger and thinner, a fantastic combination.

 Still, size isn't everything. Google is keen to make Pixel 9 Pro Fold a true flagship device. This foldable nearly matches the specs of the standard Pixel 9 Pro, packing a next-gen Tensor G4 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and 2700 nits of peak brightness. I'm also surprised to see IP68 dust and water submersion resistance certification in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. And, interestingly, Google bumped the wired charging speed up to 45 watts.

 The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's camera array also gets some upgrades—there's a 48MP wide camera, a 10.5 ultrawide lens, a 10.8MP 5x telephoto lens, and a 10MP selfie shooter. Still, this is the one area where Google's new foldable falls short of the standard Pixel 9 Pro. Customers who opt for the non-foldy phone get a 50MP main camera and a crazy 42MP selfie lens, which would've been a boon for video chats on the Fold.

 Naturally, Pixel 9 Pro Fold includes some unique software functionality. A new YouTube Multiview function fills the foldable's screen with up to four video feeds (Google hasn't specified whether this requires YouTube Premium), and a "Made You Look" photography feature flashes fun animations on the cover display when you use the inner display as a viewfinder (great for photographing small children).

The Pixel Watch 3 and Buds Pro 2 might look familiar, but Google gave the Pixel 9 series a bold new look.

 While these specs and features are all very impressive, I should point out that the original Pixel Fold's massive wingspan was a common complaint among reviewers. Pushing the phone to an even larger size may make one-handed operation even less practical. And while this phone weighs _a lot less_ than its predecessor at just 257 grams (down from 283 grams), it's still 60 grams heavier than the standard Pixel 9 Pro.

 Google also faces the same software and hardware challenges that plague all foldable phones. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold cannot lay completely flat in tablet mode despite its upgraded hinge. App support for foldables is still spotty, even with the latest Android 15 update. And while a 6:5 aspect ratio is excellent for productivity or gaming (with optimized apps), it's a somewhat awkward shape for full-screen video playback.

 The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is [available for pre-order](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F9%5Fpro%5Ffold) with prices starting at $1,799\. A one-year subscription to the [Google One AI Premium](https://win11.techidaily.com/understanding-windows-safe-slumber-techniques/) plan is included with your purchase.
