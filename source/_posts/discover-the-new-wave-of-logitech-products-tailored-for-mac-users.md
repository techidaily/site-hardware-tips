## Discover the New Wave of Logitech Products Tailored for Mac Users

Logitech is rolling out a collection of "Made for Mac" products, including Mac versions of the popular MX Key S keyboard and MX Anywhere 3S mouse.

 Technically speaking, these aren't "new" products. They are simply Mac-focused revisions of existing Logitech mice and keyboards. On that note, we've already published reviews for the standard versions of these devices.

* **[MX Anywhere 3S for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Scrolling-Any-Surface-Programmable-Bluetooth/dp/B0BPY4ZQXG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003414&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-new-mac-focused-keyboards-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) ($80):** A compact wireless mouse with a simple and reliable design. It scored a 9/10 in [our review](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-schematic-gamers-graphs/).
* **[MX Keys S for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Programmable-Backlighting-Bluetooth-Rechargeable/dp/B0BKW3LB2B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003414&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-new-mac-focused-keyboards-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) ($110):** Logitech's flagship productivity keyboard. The standard version scored an 8/10 in [our review](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-through-self-playing-options-in-fb-videos/).
* **[MX Keys S Combo for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keys-Combo-Customizable-Illumination/dp/B0BKVY4WKT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003414&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-new-mac-focused-keyboards-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) (200):** A bundle containing the MX Keys S for Mac, the MX Master 3S mouse for Mac, and a wrist rest.
* **[MX Keys Mini for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Performance-Comfortable-Ultrafast-Customizable/dp/B098JF32PT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003414&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-new-mac-focused-keyboards-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) ($100):** A compact tenkeyless version of the MX Keys S. It's effectively the same keyboard, it just doesn't have a numpad.
* **[Ergo Series Wave Keys for Mac](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Ergonomic-Cushioned-Comfortable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BTNYGHN7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003414&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-new-mac-focused-keyboards-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) ($60):** The first Mac-focused ergonomic keyboard from Logitech. Unlike the other keyboards listed here, Wave Keys features an integrated wrist rest and runs on AAA batteries.

 All of these products are compatible with the [Logitech Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html) customization suite, which you can use to set up per-app keyboard shortcuts and macros. They also support multi-device pairing, meaning that you can jump between several computers or tablets at the flip of a switch. And, earlier this year, Logitech rolled out a [desktop ChatGPT interface](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/rectifying-the-shortcomings-of-discord-search-on-windows-devices/) that can be launched from all Options+-compatible keyboards and mice.

 I should clarify that the standard versions of Logitech's MX keyboards and mice are fully compatible with both Mac and Windows. These "for Mac" revisions simply feature a keyboard layout that's more familiar to Mac usersâ€”the CMD and Option keys on the right side of the space bar are in their traditional orientation. Logitech's "for Mac" accessories also use a color scheme that more closely align with Apple's design language.

 You can find the full collection of [Logitech for Apple](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/apple.html) accessories at the Logitech website. Naturally, these products are also available at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.
