 Gaming monitors come in various shapes, sizes, resolutions, aspect ratios, and panel types. One category that has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years is the ultrawide category, with the most popular resolution being Wide Quad High-Definition ([WQHD](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/what-is-qhd-wqhd,5755.html) ). While traditional 16:9 aspect ratio QHD monitors have a 2560 x 1440 resolution, UWQHD stretches the resolution horizontally all the way to 3440 x 1440 (21:9 aspect ratio). There are even some superwide monitors available, taking the Double Quad High-Definition (DQHD) moniker, delivering a 5120 x 1440 resolution (32:9 aspect ratio).

 Most of these monitors are curved, giving you a more immersive viewing experience for such wide panels. They use varying technologies, from[VA](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/va-display-panel-definition,5770.html) to[QLED](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-lcd-panels-stops-production-2020) to[OLED](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lcd-led-led-oled-panel-difference,5394.html) . You’ll find many monitors in the 34-inch size class, although some behemoths can measure up to 49 inches across for those with more desk real estate.

 Below is a list of the best ultrawide gaming monitors currently available based on our in-depth testing and reviews.

No flaws of consequence

 The AW3423DFW is a 34-inch ultra-wide monitor with a 3440 x 1440 resolution and an 1800R curvature. But the spec that is most likely to garner the most attention (and praise) is the Quantum Dot OLED (QD-OLED) panel. As a result, you can expect ink blacks and rich colors across the board.

 The build quality is excellent– an Alienware hallmark – as is the video processing, which is sure to be a big hit with gamers.

 The AW3423DFW doesn't come cheap with a street price of over $1,000, but if you own a[GeForce RTX 4090](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review) or[RTX 4080](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review) , you owe it to yourself to try matching it with a widescreen display of this caliber.

 The UltraGear 45GR75DC stands out from the pack thanks to its Double QHD or DQHD resolution, fast refresh rate (200Hz), excellent contrast via its VA panel, and brightness levels top the competition. In addition, the[LG](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/lg) has infused the monitor with excellent build quality that we expect in this class.

 The UtraGear 45GR75DC is definitely not aimed at budget gamers thanks to its street price of around $900\. But you're still getting a lot of bang for the buck with this 45-inch behemoth. Just make sure that you have the desktop real estate to handle it.

But what you’ll really love about the XG350R-C is its vivid and accurate color that makes textures pop, skin tones look natural, and everything looks more realistic.

 If you want life-changing HDR or to use HDR with Adaptive-Sync, look elsewhere. But in addition to a 21:9 aspect ratio, the Elite XG350R-C employs an 1800mm curve radius that engulfed us with solid image quality, making for an immersive ultrawide experience.

 The Corsair Xeneon Flex is a unique offering in the premium gaming monitor segment. It features a bendable OLED panel that can convert from a flat panel to one with an 800R curve using two handles that spring out from the sides of the chassis. This arrangement gives the Xeneon Flex the best of both worlds when it comes to panel types.

 In addition to the excellent contrast and color that come with using an OLED panel, the monitor also features a fast 240Hz refresh rate. You'll also find support for AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync.

 However, we must mention that the 3440 x 1440 resolution isn't exactly the best with a panel this large (45 inches). So pixel density suffers, and we would have liked to have seen better HDR performance.

 With that said, the novelty of the "transforming" display might be worth Xeneon Flex's $1,700 street price if you're looking for an attention-getting centerpiece for your gaming PC setup.

 The ViewSonic Elite XG341C-2K ticks a lot of the right boxes when it comes to gaming monitors. Not only does it have a 3440 x 1440 resolution with a native 165 Hz refresh rate, but it can also be overclocked to 200 Hz. It is both AMD FreeSync (to 165 Hz) and Nvidia G-Sync compliant and has good build quality.

 However, the Elite XG341C-2K stands out with its VA panel with Mini LED backlighting. This gives the monitor rich colors out of the box, incredible contrast (which we would expect from a VA panel), and an eye-searing maximum HDR brightness of 1,400 nits. And thanks to Mini LED backlighting, the Elite XG341C-2K has 1,152 dimming zones versus the fewer than 400 that we typically see with a FALD panel.

 There are a couple of gotchas, though, regarding the Elite XG341C-2K. For example, brightness controls are locked on when using Active-Sync, and Active-Sync can't be enabled at all when taking advantage of the overclocked 200 Hz refresh rate. However, if those are manageable for your gaming priorities, the Acer Elite XG341C-2K is an excellent choice for ultrawide gaming monitors in the under $1,500 price segment.

 The ASRock PG34WQ15R2B is an ultrawide gaming monitor with excellent fundamentals and a price tag that won't break the bank. Its specs are about what you'd expect for this class, with a 3440 x 1440 resolution, 165 Hz native refresh rate, DisplayHDR 400 support, and a 1500R curve. As expected, you'll find a VA panel that's good for a contrast ratio of 3,000:1.

 Regarding color, accuracy is top-notch, and it offers best-in-class HDR image quality. There's also low input lag along with an easy-to-use OSD and control scheme. The monitor even includes a built-in Wi-Fi antenna to extend the range of a PCIe wireless networking card (if your desktop PC is so-equipped).

 However, with a street price under $350, ASRock had to make some compromises. For example, there's only one setting for overdrive in the OSD, which didn't result in a difference in the on-screen action. There's also a hint of gamma issues (value of 2.00), resulting in a somewhat hazy image.

 But overall, the ASRock PG34WQ15R2B offers a solid package and deserves a spot on our list.

 With OLED panels invading every facet of the gaming monitor sector, it should be no surprise that they pop up in even the largest offerings. That’s definitely the case with the Philips Evnia 49M2C8900, which has a massive OLED panel stretching an impressive 48 inches. So what do you get with your $1,500 investment into widescreen gaming bliss?

 Well, for starters, you get a resolution of 5120 x 1440 and a maximum refresh rate of 240 Hz, which is impressive for an OLED panel of this size. Philips lists the response time as an OLED-typical 0.03 ms, and you get a maximum brightness of 450 nits in HDR mode (250 nits in SDR). Regarding connectivity, you'll find two HDMI 2.1 ports, one each for DisplayPort 1.4 and USB-C. In addition to a 3.5 mm headphone jack, Philips gives you four surprisingly good-sounding 7.5-watt speakers with DTS tuning.

 The end result is a monitor that provides accurate color without the need for calibration out of the box. Video processing is also top-notch, and you even get a remote for controlling the Evnia 49M2C8900 all the way across a room (for when you want to use it as a large-screen TV for watching movies and TV shows).

 No product is completely perfect, and the Evnia 49M2C8900 is let down by some crushed details when viewing HDR content. We can't forget the $1,499 asking price, which is likely above the budget of many enthusiasts. However, it's hard to scoff at that price if you have the budget (and desk space) to accommodate this impressive OLED beast.

### Shopping Tips for Gaming Monitors

 When trying to buy the best gaming monitor for your PC, consider the following:

+ __G-Sync or FreeSync?__ G-Sync only works with PCs with Nvidia graphics cards, while FreeSync only works with systems using AMD ones. You can technically run G-Sync on a FreeSync-only monitor, but performance isn't guaranteed. Even though not every gaming monitor is officially G-Sync certified by Nvidia, most of the units that we've tested support it just fine. For a detailed comparison of the two technologies' performance, see our[Nvidia G-Sync vs. AMD FreeSync](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/gsync-vs-freesync-nvidia-amd-monitor) comparison article.
+ __Which resolutions?__ Some popular resolutions include UWQHD (3440 x 1440), DQHD (5120 x 1440), 5K Ultrawide (5120 x 2160), and Super Ultrawide (3840 x 1200). Whereas a traditional 4K (3840 x 2160) monitor would allow you to fit two documents side by side comfortably, a 5120 x 1440 monitor would up that count to three.
+ __What panel tech?__ For image quality, IPS < VA < OLED. IPS displays have slightly slower response times but better color than VA monitors. The best gaming monitors for contrast are VA, but VA also has slower response times. Displays with OLED panels are expensive but are much more colorful.
+ __Refresh rate?__ Higher numbers mean smoother images and the ability to see fast-moving targets better in games. Gamers should look for 100 Hz at the bare minimum, along with the lowest available response time. However, some monitors on our list offer even higher refresh rates at up to 240 Hz.
