##  What to Look For With a NAS Device in 2024

 Anyone looking to access files on multiple devices throughout their home (or small business) can benefit from adding a NAS device to their setup. These essentially work as storage locations that can be reached by any gadget with the right credentials, eliminating the need to email files back and forth or load them onto thumb drives.

 However, not all NAS devices are built to the same standards. Brands like Synology and Asustor are almost always reliable, but even then, you'll need to ensure the NAS device you're purchasing will work for your setup. This includes determining how many bays you'll need for storage and how much power you'll need to run your network.

 For example, many NAS devices are equipped with heaps of RAM and a premium CPU, so you can quickly access files or stream content without stuttering. Others might only include one or two bays and entry-level components, making them ideal for home systems but lackluster for dedicated media streaming.

 Checking system compatibility is also important. Nearly all NAS devices will work with Windows, while Mac users will want to verify that they won't run into any issues when trying to access the network via MacBook or an iMac. And if you're trying to use a NAS for Plex, you'll have a [whole lot of other factors](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/comprehensive-apple-watch-series-9-analysis-the-ultimate-wearable-tech-evaluation/) to consider.

 With that in mind, here are the best NAS devices of 2024\. Our picks cover a wide range of budgets and applications, ensuring you'll find something that fits your needs.

Synology

| Pros                                  | Cons                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Powerful Synology DiskStation Manager | Only a two-bay system |
| Great price                           |                       |
| Compact design                        |                       |
| Successor to the popular DS220+       |                       |

 The Synology DiskStation DS220+ was wildly popular years ago, and its successor, the [Synology DiskStation DS224+](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU2004555%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fareyouahuman%253Freferer%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.newegg.com%25252Fsynology-ds124%25252Fp%25252FN82E16822108840%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fsynology-ds124%252Fp%252FN82E16822108840) is just as exciting. With a compact design, access to the Synology DiskStation Manager software, and a surprisingly great price, it's the best option for most shoppers seeking a NAS device.

 With an Intel Celeron J4125 CPU capable of getting speeds up to 2.0GHz, 2GB RAM, and a variety of USB and LAN ports, you're getting a good amount of power and connectivity with the DS224+. It is, however, only a two-bay system—so if you need heaps of storage, you might want to look elsewhere. But this should be more than enough firepower for most home applications or small businesses.

 A big selling point is the Synology DiskStation Manager software. This lets you easily manage files, centralize all your digital media, and access other tools to boost your productivity and enhance your security. If you already own a DS220+, then you may not need to upgrade to the DS224+. But if you're shopping for your first NAS or want to upgrade from an older model, this is the one to get.

Synology

| Pros                         | Cons                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Synology DiskStation Manager | 1GB RAM               |
| Less than $200               | Only a one-bay system |
| Two-year warranty            |                       |

 The [Synology DiskStation DS124](https://www.amazon.com/Synology-1-Bay-DiskStation-DS124-Diskless/dp/B0BYJ165RS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004555&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the more affordable cousin of the DS224+ mentioned above. Despite a price tag under $200, you'll still get access to the powerful Synology DiskStation Manager software, a nice two-year warranty, and a slim design that'll fit into most home offices without any problems.

 Before singing its praises, there are a few caveats to note. For one, this NAS device only has one bay, meaning there's not a lot of room to expand or upgrade your storage space. It also features just 1GB of RAM, which isn't ideal for small businesses or homes that require the fastest speeds.

 Beyond that, this is still a reliable Synology NAS device. It's a great fit for storing all your digital photos or home movies, though you may want to look elsewhere if you're looking to use Plex as this doesn't offer any hardware accelerated transcoding (a key feature sought after for Plex). In other words, this is an affordable yet reliable drive that's a great first step into the world of NAS devices. Be sure to give it a look if you like the DS224+ but want something suitable for a smaller budget.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Certified compatibility with Plex | Plex Pass required for most features |
| 2GB RAM                           | Aggressive "gamer aesthetic"         |
| Speeds up to 2.7GHz               |                                      |

 There are many requirements to consider when seeking a [NAS for Plex](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-virtual-boards-with-ease-a-guide-to-using-google-meet-on-diverse-devices/), and the [Asustor AS5202T](https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5202T-Inspired-Attached-Dual-Core/dp/B07PW9DV56?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004555&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) checks pretty much every box. Not only is it relatively affordable, but it also providescertified compatibility for Plex, 2GB RAM, and both hardware-accelerated transcoding and software transcoding.

 In other words, the AS5202T is well-equipped to run Plex. Videos will stream without any stuttering or slowdown, and a three-year manufacturer warranty means you can rest easy knowing your collection is safe. Its exterior design is a bit more aggressive than others on this list, but that's a minor knock on what's otherwise a well-rounded NAS for Plex.

 Other notable features include a CPU that churns out speeds up to 2.7GHz, two 2.5 gigabit Ethernet ports, and 4K hardware decoding. Keep in mind you'll need a [Plex Pass](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004555/https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) to make full use of the rig, though anyone serious about their entertainment collection likely already has one.

QNAP

| Pros            | Cons      |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Four-bay system | Expensive |
| Supports Mac    |           |
| 8GB RAM         |           |

 Most NAS devices work fine with Macs, but the QNAP TS-464 is one of the best. In addition to native support for Mac devices, it has four bays for heaps of storage, speeds up to 2.9GHz, and an impressive 8GB RAM.

 That makes it not just the best NAS for Mac but also a great option for anyone seeking a premium upgrade to their current entry-level setup. Add 2.5GbE connectivity and a surprisingly compact size for a four-bay NAS, and it's easy to see why the TS-464 is so popular.

 The biggest drawback to this product is its price, which hovers over $550\. But since it gets you impressive speeds, is equipped with a ridiculous amount of RAM for a NAS device, and works well with Mac's Time Machine for backups, it's the ideal companion for Apple enthusiasts.

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Six SSD slots       | Might be excessive for small businesses |
| 4GB RAM             |                                         |
| Speeds up to 2.9GHz |                                         |

 If you're running a small business, a reliable NAS device is worth its weight in gold. The[Asustor Flashstor 6 FS6706T](https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-Flashstor-FS6706T-Computer-Attached/dp/B0BZCM22WD?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004555&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) should fit all your criteria, with a six-bay system with 4GB RAM and support for SSDs—making it both fast and reliable.

 Inside you'll find a 10nm Quad-Core Intel Celeron N5105 to get you speeds up to 2.9GHz, two 2.5GbE ports, and six M.2 NVMe slots. That should be more than enough for most small businesses. If you need something more, it might be time to start paying an IT guy to free up your time. Other highlights include an HDMI port, 4GB DDR4, and a footprint that's about the width and length of a standard piece of paper.

 The Flashtor 6 offers a lot of firepower, and if your small business is just getting started or you don't work with highly demanding files, this NAS might be excessive for your needs. But if you want to future-proof your setup or need something fast enough to handle massive data transfers, the Flashstor 6 is a solid choice.

 Cloud storage typically requires a monthly fee, while NAS devices usually just require a one-time purchase. However, you may have to perform a bit more maintenance with NAS devices than cloud servers, which are run by a third-party.

### Does a NAS device always need to be on?

 Yes, most NAS devices are designed to be online 24/7 without the need to power them down. If they are turned off, devices will not be able to connect to them and access their files.
