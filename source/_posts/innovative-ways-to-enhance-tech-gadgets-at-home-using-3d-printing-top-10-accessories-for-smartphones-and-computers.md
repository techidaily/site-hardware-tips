 If you think about it, lots of phone and computer accessories are just pieces of plastic shaped specifically for their purpose. Also, if something's made of plastic, it can likely be 3D printed.

 Better yet, you might not even need to make the 3D model yourself. A welcome bonus of buying a good 3D printer is the huge online community of enthusiasts, which provides hundreds of thousands of models you can print, organized in online databases.

 There are a few good repositories you can check, like [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) and [Pinshape](https://pinshape.com/). For this list, we'll link models available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) because it only lists free 3D models, while the other two also feature paid ones.

##  1\. Cases for Just About Anything

 A good starting point is printing cases. It's probably not surprising that you can get protective covers for phones, like [this one for the Galaxy S22 Ultra](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5339723), and laptops, like [this one for the 2019 Razer Blade Stealth](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3945076). Although there's a lot more down that rabbit hole.

 If you bought a SATA-to-USB adapter, there's [this case to prevent your HDD from being exposed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:259342). There's [one that protects your Nintendo Switch cartridges](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2517867) with a design that probably won't please Nintendo's always-on-duty legal team. What about [a chest—complete with a functional key—to carry your tabletop RPG dice and minis](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:548151) around?

![Raspberry Pi A+ case in the shape of BMO, character from Adventure Time, running RetroPie](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/raspberry-pi-a-case-in-the-shape-of-bmo-character-from-adventure-time-running-retropie.jpg) 

Thingiverse / 3Derp

 Products with more standardized designs have a myriad of options available. There are literally [dozens of Raspberry Pi cases](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=raspberry), for [lots of different models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:410003), ranging from [a TARDIS-shaped one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2430122) to [a handheld console](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2658920) to a [full-fledged laptop](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3134603). Memory cards also have varied case models for download, like [this one that also stores USB thumb drives](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4784411) or [this one that holds microSD cards](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6310679) and uses a microSD to SD adapter as a lid.

##  2\. Port Covers

 With [iPhones finally adopting USB-C](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-science-and-magic-behind-full-circle-films/), we're heading towards the [single-port utopia](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-ppt-and-vo-integration-tutorial/). For now, though, there are still lots of [different connection types](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-top-youtube-spotlight-key-influences-on-your-viewership-position/). And whether you need [USB-C](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3459200), [USB-A](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3805674), [Lightning](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1021450), [DisplayPort](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4278971), [HDMI](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1789832), [headphone jack](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3459190), or [just about any port](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=port+cover) on any electronics you can imagine, you're—pun intended—covered. If you want to be extra-safe, be sure to [print cable caps](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=cable+cap) as well.

##  3\. Strain Reliefs/Cable Savers

 Since we're talking about cables, there's another way 3D printing can help: strain reliefs and cable savers. The former prevents your wiring from peeling, while the latter is an emergency measure if the cord is already [worn out but still functional](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-guide-how-to-make-money-from-instagram/).

![3D printed, dark gray cable saver wrapped around a white USB-A connector](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3d-printed-dark-gray-cable-saver-wrapped-around-a-white-usb-a-connector.jpeg) 

Thingiverse / gubutek

 There are more generic strain reliefs, like these for [USB cables](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9956), [headphones](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4789089), [HDMI cords](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5580540), [Ethernet connectors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2773556), and [Lightning](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1298189) as well. However, you may find less common ones, too, like [this one for the Surface Pro](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2345742). The same goes for [cable savers](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=cable+saver&page=1), with lots of formats to choose from.

##  4\. Cable Holders and Organizers

 While we're at it, let's also add holders and organizers to the mix. [This one lets you kind of "plug" your USB cables to a wall](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755186), so they're always at hand, but there are also organizers if you'd rather have them [sitting at your desk](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892387). Don't forget to add [identifying cable tags](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3159175)!

 There's [one to keep the cord from tangling during transport](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1107638), too, and, if you own a MacBook, you can try [this wrapper that also acts as a case for the charger](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:463633). Some Apple laptop models may benefit from [this cable lock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:202491), which keeps all the wiring in place.

##  5\. Headset Hooks

 No gaming PC setup is complete without a headset hook. In case you have just got home from the store and realized you forgot to buy one, fret not! Your 3D printer is here to help!

![Wall with various 3D printed headset holders](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wall-with-various-3d-printed-headset-holders.jpeg) 

Thingiverse / ztxdk

 You can even choose where to place it. There are options to put it [under your desk](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:245932), on [your monitor's corner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1324319), on [your computer tower's side](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1505298) (with the help of double-sided tape), or even on [your cubicle's wall](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2848589), if you're in the office.

##  6\. Webcam Covers

 Laptops (and dedicated webcams) with privacy covers are becoming more common, but they're far from mainstream. If you want a cheap and fast solution to ensure you're not being watched, a 3D-printed camera cover works better than a piece of paper, and doesn't leave your computer sticky like using tape.

 There's [this one with square edges](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3383461), [this model with rounded ones](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3605827), and [this one with... Well, with both](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4099067). You can also get a more straightforward one, that just [slides over your laptop's lid](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:556704), or [decorated covers for die-hard brand fans](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131064). This ["anti-spy" model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:655641) deserves a mention as well for being very on-point.

##  7\. Keycaps

 Perhaps you got unlucky and purchased a keyboard with nonstandard keycaps, [like Logitech's MX Mechanical duo](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-screencasting-with-google-meet/). Perhaps you're just in need of a change and don't want to wait for online-purchased keycaps to arrive. Well, why not use your 3D printer to make your own?

 You can get more generic ones, like [this skeletonized keycap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3183528) that will fit amazingly with your [ultralight mouse](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/tracing-the-flow-of-money-in-consumer-opinions/). [This 3D model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4542301) can be configured to print keycaps with varied angles in an OEM profile. There's also [this sliced model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3841390) which looks great but may be somewhat hard to customize. And [this one with pins that fit perfectly into LEGO blocks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4823151). Oh, and you're also served if you just want [regular keycaps that you can customize yourself](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2783650).

![Pair of LEGO-shaped keycaps, one upside down showing the Cherry MX stem, the other showing the mounting pins](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pair-of-lego-shaped-keycaps-one-upside-down-showing-the-cherry-mx-stem-the-other-showing-the-mounting-pins.jpg) 

Thingiverse / merberich

 There are more elaborate designs as well. Star Wars fan? Get a [Mandalorian keycap set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5234703)! More into Pokémon? Here goes a [pokéball](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3685198), a [low-poly Pikachu](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1200732), and [a more detailed Charmander](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4222096).

 There's also [a Master Chief helmet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5137563) if you like Halo, and this [Diablo-shaped keycap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3013443) to show your love for the RPG series. The latter's sharp edges might be a continuous source of physical pain, though, but it may work as a more stylish version of the [anti-ragequit keycap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1618214).

 Last, but not least: you can also [3D print a keycap puller](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1318655).

##  8\. Replacement Parts

 Often, when a small piece or accessory breaks, we're tempted to just keep using the device without repairing or replacing that part. You may think it isn't worth the hassle of finding a replacement, buying it online, and waiting for the package to arrive, but what if you could just print it?

[Laptop feet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3508283), [keyboard legs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:192367), [battery covers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6367104), [headset hinges](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2092430), the [cap protecting your Apple Pencil's charging connector](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1366689), or the [hooks used to hold the cable on a MacBook charger](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:192224)... There are lots of parts you can print instead of living with the (admittedly minor) inconvenience of their absence.

##  9\. Laptop, Tablet and Phone Stands

 You wouldn't believe how many different laptop/phone/tablet stands there are on 3D model repositories. Like, dozens of them. We selected a few to show you the possibilities, but be sure to [check other stand models](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=stand) for yourself.

 If you just want a simple stand to make your laptop higher, [check this one out](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:383418). There's also [a smaller, similar one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2120591) that works well for tablets and phones.

![Pair of 3D printed mounts stands for electronics, one with an adjustable arm, holding a camera, the other with a fixed position, holding a phone](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pair-of-3d-printed-mounts-stands-for-electronics-one-with-an-adjustable-arm-holding-a-camera-the-other-with-a-fixed-position-holding-a-phone.jpeg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Thingiverse / HeyVye

 Need a [stand with an adjustable height](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4717731)? No worries! This one is listed as made for drawing tablets, but will work just as well with regular tablets and perhaps even with lighter laptops.

 There are foldable stands, too, like [this one for laptops](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2447297) and [this one for phones](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3146835). They work great if you have space constraints, or want a portable solution to keep in your backpack.

 Collapsible stands also may work for portability. [This one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3038606) has two pieces that cross each other, while [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5740323) uses clever fittings to make it sturdy both when mounted and for carrying.

 Some minimalist laptop stands may pick your interest as well. [The Fulcrum](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2742574) is a lever-type stand that uses your laptop's own weight to keep itself attached. [This one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2961824) works similarly but requires a thinner machine. And [this one, for phones and tablets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4599475), allows for two different angles on a single, small piece.

 To close this section, take a look at the peculiar [Octopus Stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:158069). It's limited to tablets, but apparently, it's very popular—with over 8,000 downloads. It yielded a [Version Two](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:213990), and [a smaller Version Three](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:607518), better suited for phones.

##  10\. Silly and Fun Accessories

 Just because something's useful doesn't mean it has to be all that serious. This [laptop tummy holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2198112), for instance, does exactly what its name implies. The [laptop drawer stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5491932) too: pull the drawer, place the stand over it, and you have solved the lack of space on your desk.

 Ever heard of the [DIY phone amplifier with party cups and a cardboard tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ4G5U1v%5Fi0)? You can 3D print [a slightly less hacky](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3535043) version of it. Want an inexpensive (and, to be fair, not very trustworthy) way to protect your data? Check this [USB drive cryptex](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1196989) out. There are also wired earphone holders, like [this bat-signal-shaped one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1041882) or [this one that fits into an Altoids case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2764239).

##  3D Printing Is As Useful As It's Fun

 Whether you're a newcomer to the 3D printing community or a seasoned veteran, there are always new projects to discover. However, if printing accessories gets too boring, you may consider [3D printing a whole new 3D printer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1023641). Or [a house](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-venturing-into-video-production-top-5-mac-videographers-for-2024/).
