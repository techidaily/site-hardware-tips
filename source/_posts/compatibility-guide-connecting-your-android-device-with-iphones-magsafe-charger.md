 The iPhone 12 introduced a feature called "[MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/)" that allows accessories and chargers to magnetically connect to the back of the phone. You might be a little jealous if you have an Android phone, but you don't have to be.

##  MagSafe 101

 Not to be confused with "MagSafe" MacBook chargers, the iPhone 12 and [iPhone 13](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/play-mkv-movies-on-moto-g24-is-it-possible-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) include a built-in magnetic ring on the back. This can be used for a number of things, including wireless chargers, battery packs, wallets, and more.

 Despite not being designed for these accessories, some of them work with Android devices. However, the magnetic connection is not nearly as strong as it is with an iPhone. You can buy [special cases for some Samsung Galaxy phones](https://www.reviewgeek.com/93037/moments-new-cases-bring-magsafe-to-some-galaxy-devices/), but we'll show you an even simpler method.

 iPhones were designed explicitly to use these magnetic accessories, your Android phone was not. There is a risk that the magnets won't play nice with your device and cause some damage. This is unlikely, but not impossible.

##  What You'll Need

 In order for this to work, there are a couple of things you'll need. The exact things you'll need will depend on which type of MagSafe accessories you want to use.

 The one thing everyone will need is a simple metal ring for the back of their device. This gives the MagSafe accessory something to grab on to. You can get a [pack of six for $10](https://www.amazon.com/Wannap-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Sticker/dp/B075YB8C7F/?tag=htg-v2-4qdt3r5-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207556&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774757%2Fhow-to-use-iphone-magsafe-chargers-with-an-android-phone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) on Amazon and simply peel off the film to stick it to your phone.

 Now, if you're only interested in non-charging accessories---such as a wallet---the placement of this ring isn't super important. Just put it in a spot that feels comfortable in your hand. Slap on the accessory and you're good to go.

 To use MagSafe charging accessories, there are a couple of extra considerations. First and foremost, your phone needs to have wireless charging. Second, the metal ring needs to be placed where the wireless charging coils are located. You can find that by simply moving the charger around the back of your device until it starts charging.

##  Why Does This Work?

 You might be wondering how iPhone "exclusive" chargers can work with random Android devices. It's all thanks to universal charging standards.

 MagSafe power accessories use the [Qi charging standard](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-users-download-vllo-and-find-alternative-solutions/)\---the same standard that Android devices use for wireless charging. It may seem like Apple simply added some magnets to hold the chargers in place, but there's a little more going on behind the scenes.

 iPhones communicate with the charging accessories over the MagSafe connection. This tells the charger it's connected to an iPhone and it can charge at higher speeds. So while any Qi charger can wirelessly charge your Android device, you won't get those higher speeds.

 So you've got the metal ring stuck to the back of your phone, now what? As alluded to in the section above, you can pretty much use [any MagSafe accessory now](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/).

 The one major exception is power accessories. Your Android device needs to have wireless charging if you want to use [Apple's MagSafe charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8Q6LYW?ots=1&slotNum=3&imprToken=2cbee1e2-5821-42fb-d00&tag=htg-v2-4qdt3r5-20&linkCode=w50&th=1&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207556&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774757%2Fhow-to-use-iphone-magsafe-chargers-with-an-android-phone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or a [battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8Q6LYW?ots=1&slotNum=3&imprToken=2cbee1e2-5821-42fb-d00&tag=htg-v2-4qdt3r5-20&linkCode=w50&th=1&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207556&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774757%2Fhow-to-use-iphone-magsafe-chargers-with-an-android-phone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). After all, MagSafe is essentially just wireless charging with magnets.

 Other than that, though, you can go wild with MagSafe accessories. [Car mounts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098HD3B4L?ots=1&slotNum=2&imprToken=2cbee1e2-5821-42fb-d00&tag=htg-v2-4qdt3r5-20&linkCode=w50&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207556&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F774757%2Fhow-to-use-iphone-magsafe-chargers-with-an-android-phone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [wallets](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/surfacepad-for-iphone), [tripods](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1662931-REG/joby%5Fgriptight%5Ftripod%5Fmount%5Ffor.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU207556), and more. Head on over to Amazon or Best Buy and search for "MagSafe accessories." The iPhone accessory ecosystem is very large, you should be able to find something cool.

 The one thing to keep in mind is these accessories were made for iPhones. Android devices come in all shapes and sizes, so they may not work perfectly on every device. Make sure you're taking measurements and thinking about the shape of your phone's back.
