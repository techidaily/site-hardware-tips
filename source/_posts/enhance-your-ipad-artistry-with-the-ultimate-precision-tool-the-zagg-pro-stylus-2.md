## Enhance Your iPad Artistry with the Ultimate Precision Tool - The ZAGG Pro Stylus 2!

Looking for a new iPad stylus, but don't want to pay Apple Pencil prices? The [ZAGG Pro Stylus 2](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Pro-Stylus-Rejection-Recognition-dp-B0CDMDGSSJ/dp/B0CDMDGSSJ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is available for under $50, and it may be just what you need.

 A stylus feels like a near-essential [iPad accessory](https://techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-apple-iphone-6s-data-completely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/). While you may not think much about grabbing one at first, if you plan to use your iPad for any sort of productivity or artistic purposes, a stylus suddenly becomes a big deal.

 The problem is that the defacto iPad stylus, the Apple Pencil, is expensive. The [second-generation Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) (which is [the model most iPads currently use](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/did-your-apple-iphone-6-passcode-change-itself-unlock-it-now-drfone-by-drfone-ios/)) retails for $129, and while all the features are worth it, it's a hard financial pill to swallow if you're only planning on using a stylus occasionally.

 In that case, it's better to look into third-party styluses for your iPad. We recommend the [ZAGG Pro Stylus 2](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Pro-Stylus-Rejection-Recognition-dp-B0CDMDGSSJ/dp/B0CDMDGSSJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), and it's currently on sale for under $50\. The [gray colorway](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Pro-Stylus-Rejection-Recognition-dp-B0CDMDGSSJ/dp/B0CDMDGSSJ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is $47.99, while the [pink](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Pro-Stylus-Rejection-Recognition-dp-B0CDMCQ1QD/dp/B0CDMDGSSJ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) and [white](https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Pro-Stylus-Rejection-Recognition-dp-B0CDMBX3QK/dp/B0CDMDGSSJ?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004596&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fzagg-pro-stylus-2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) colors are slightly less expensive at $47.17 and $47.10, respectively. Compared to the price of the Apple Pencil, this is a steal of a price.

 You don't lose too many features by going with the Pro Stylus 2, either, as we go into in [our review of the stylus](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uncomplicated-techniques-archiving-your-google-voice-calls/):

 If you're someone who just wants to take notes and occasionally sketch, then the savings Zagg brings to the table are likely worth it. You'll keep some extra cash in your pocket and get a pretty solid experience all around. The dual-tip design, wireless charging on the side of your iPad, the whole shebang.

 The big feature missing from ZAGG's stylus is the lack of pressure sensitivity. This can be a deal breaker for serious artists, but if you're looking for a stylus mainly to take notes and navigate social media, this feature won't be terribly missed.
