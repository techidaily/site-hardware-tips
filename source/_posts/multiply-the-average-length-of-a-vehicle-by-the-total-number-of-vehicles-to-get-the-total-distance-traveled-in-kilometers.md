 It's that time of year when the tech world awaits Google's yearly developer convention. The Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, readies itself to play host to yet another installment of Google I/O on May 14th, 2024\. Here's what we're expecting from the event this year.

##  Gemini and AI Will Take Center Stage

Google

[At Google's highly anticipated I/O conference](https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/resolving-msvcrt10dll-file-missing-a-step-by-step-guide/), all eyes will be on "Gemini"—the company's flagship AI model, formerly known as "[Bard](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhance-branding-the-ultimate-guide-to-custom-urls-for-youtube/)." Gemini has already made waves with its [remarkable capabilities](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-live-broadcast-battlefield-obs-versus-shadowplay/), but this year's event will most likely reveal its next evolution, setting new benchmarks for its AI performance.

 However, Gemini's rise has [not been without challenges](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-starting-point-connecting-seamlessly-via-instagram/). Its image generator faced backlash for producing historically inaccurate visuals like multi-racial Nazi depictions. Google promptly paused the feature, acknowledging the misstep and vowing to release an improved version, potentially at I/O.

 The conference may shed more light on ["Gemma," the lightweight open-source variant of Gemini](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/elevate-your-youtube-game-effective-strategies-for-scriptwriting-using-chatgpt-technology/) aimed at responsible AI development. Google has already released Gemma's model weights ([Gemma 2B and 7B](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/)) and a Responsible Generative AI Toolkit to support safe applications of this powerful technology.

 Beyond Gemini, Google's vision for AI integration spans its entire product suite, [from Messages](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/begin-a-new-era-of-editing-with-xps-video-suite/) to [Maps and YouTube](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-compilation-top-8-4k-ultra-hd-players/). The possibilities seem endless, and I/O could offer a tantalizing glimpse into this future.

 One area of particular interest is [Google's attempt to replace its long-standing Assistant with Gemini](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-unleash-creativity-without-breaking-the-bank-top-9-affordable-editors/) on Android. While the transition hasn't been seamless, with some features still lacking, anticipation runs high for Google to announce expanded Gemini capabilities, bringing its full power to our fingertips.

##  We’ll See More of Android 15 and a New Beta

![Person holding a Google Pixel 8 Pro showing the Android 15 logo.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/53533188423_c6faca52a2_o.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Google will likely highlight the latest version of its operating system, Android 15, at Google I/O. [The first developer preview released in mid-February](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-cinemas-best-shoot-techniques-the-ultimate-guide-for-24/) teased some exciting features, but the real excitement is yet to come.

 Under the hood, Android 15, codenamed "Vanilla Ice Cream" (because who doesn't love a tasty treat?), promises further refinements to the user interface, improved battery life, [enhanced security measures](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-oppo-a38-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and a host of under-the-hood optimizations that will make the Android experience smoother and more efficient than ever before.

 One of the most significant changes rumored to be part of Android 15 is the introduction of a "Private Space"—a secure, sandboxed environment within your device where you can store sensitive data, files, and apps, completely isolated from prying eyes.

 Beyond these tantalizing morsels, whispers abound that [Android 15 could finally bring satellite connectivity to select devices](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/identifying-fake-gpt-binco-coins-a-guide-to-recognizing-scams/), enabling you to send out an SOS complete with your location when venturing off the beaten path and out of cellular range.

 The first public beta of Android 15 is slated for April, so we'll likely see the second beta released during I/O. Developers are eager to really dig into a stable build, but if tradition continues, Android 15 will likely debut alongside the Pixel 9 series in October 2024, making for one delicious update.

##  The Pixel 8a Might Be the Only Hardware Unveiled

![Google Pixel 8a leaked render.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/google-pixel-8a-renders.png) 

[Smartprix](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/google-pixel-8a-exclusive-first-look/)

 The mid-range Pixel A-series hasn't exactly been a stunner over the years, but it's consistently delivered a nice balance of performance and affordability. The upcoming Pixel 8A looks to continue that tradition, following in the footsteps of [last year's Pixel 7a](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-parallel-playback-prowess-for-2024/), which [debuted at Google I/O](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-laughlab-design-suite/).

 Word on the street is the 8a may borrow some premium features from its pricier Pixel 8 sibling, making it an enticing option for those wanting flagship-level performance without the sky-high price tag.

 One of the [juicier rumors](https://twitter.com/ShishirShelke1/status/1770331179926901083?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1770331179926901083%7Ctwgr%5Ec248b27315b53c73484e4d0138bbd9fa7d9d257a%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5F&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpreview%2F2002443%2F) is that the 8A could rock a silky-smooth 120Hz OLED display with a scorching 1,400 nit peak HDR brightness. If true, that'd put it in the same league as some of the best mobile displays out there for vibrant colors and fluid visuals. Pair that with a sleek design [inspired by the Pixel 8](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-simple-guide-youtube-to-mp3-on-mac/), and you may have a real head-turner aesthetically.

 Under the hood, the Pixel 8a might run on Google's latest Tensor G3 chip—packing potent performance along with advanced AI smarts. Whether it's real-time translation, computational photography trickery, or something else, that Tensor silicon could unlock all sorts of cool new experiences. But here's where it gets fascinating—the 8a may offer DisplayPort output.

 So far, it's looking like the Pixel 8a will be the only hardware we see at I/O. The Pixel 9 series, Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Fold 2 will likely be reserved until the Fall.

##  How to Watch Google I/O 2024

 Are you excited about what could be in store for I/O this year? If you didn't get a special invitation from Google to attend in person, don't worry! Like last year, you can watch the keynote livestream online on May 14th and catch up on any sessions you missed later on demand. The live broadcast and recorded videos will be available on the [Google I/O website](https://io.google/) and [Google's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Google) so that you can tune in from anywhere.
