## Fixing the Pixel 6 Pro: Resolving Screen Flicker Issues Soon

When the [Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro were first announced](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/unblocking-windows-upgrade-error-xc004f050-code/), everyone was extremely excited. The [reviews backed up the excitement](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-itel-p55t-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/). Now that the dust has settled, there's an issue with the Pixel 6 Pro's screen flickering, and it looks like Google is going to take a while to fix it.

 Unfortunately, several Pixel 6 Pro owners are complaining that their devices are suffering from screen flickering, which is unacceptable on an expensive flagship phone (or any phone, for that matter). Google has acknowledged the issue in a [support post](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/133351387/pixel-6-pro-display-residual-light?hl=en), but the company won't have a software fix ready until December.

 Google said, "Pixel 6 Pro users may notice slight, transient display artifacts when the device is turned off, and when they press on the power button with slight pressure but not enough to turn it on." [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review-3042248/) backed up the report, as cited in its Pixel 6 Pro review.

 Fortunately, the issue is mostly avoidable and not caused by a hardware problem. Google says, "To avoid seeing this, when the power is off, do not cycle the power button. When you want to use the phone, hold the power button down long enough to turn it on."

 Thankfully, this isn't the sort of issue that's completely ruining the Pixel 6 Pro experience, but it's still not something users are happy about, and it's good to see that Google is working on a fix, even if it'll take a little longer than some people would like.
