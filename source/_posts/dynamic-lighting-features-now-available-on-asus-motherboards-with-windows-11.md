## Dynamic Lighting Features Now Available on Asus Motherboards with Windows 11

One huge problem with RGB lighting is that it's not standardized at all. ARGB has tried to address that problem, but it can still get tricky to have RGB all synced up for certain peripherals and hardware due to the need to download third-party software. Windows Dynamic Lighting wants to fix that, and now, ASUS is adding support for that on its motherboards.

 ASUS is set to join the growing list of manufacturers embracing Microsoft's [Dynamic Lighting](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ving-affiliate-success-with-online-videos-for-2024/) feature in Windows 11\. If you're not familiar with the feature, it allows you to tweak your RGB lighting from your operating system's settings. With ASUS' move, you'll be able to modify your motherboard's RGB lighting directly from Windows 11 settings, eliminating the need for separate apps like ASUS' Armory Crate or third-party tools. Other hardware makers [like Logitech](https://some-tips.techidaily.com/the-art-of-engaging-crafting-compelling-reddit-content-for-2024/) have also rolled out support for Dynamic Lighting over the past year.

 The feature, which allows for native control of RGB lighting devices through the open HID LampArray standard, is being rolled out as beta BIOS updates for Asus' AMD 600 and Intel 700 series motherboards. A full release is expected in the coming weeks, and you'll probably want to wait for that instead. But the implications of this are huge if you're the kind to go all in on RGB lighting (and pretend it makes your games perform better). Dynamic Lighting integration offers basic controls for brightness, colors, and effects, streamlining the user experience. It also sidesteps potential compatibility issues that can arise with third-party software like OpenRGB.

 The Intel Z790 beta BIOS update also includes a microcode update intended to address some game crashing issues encountered with Intel processors. But the BIOS update should be coming soon to both AMD and Intel laptops. If you have an older motherboard, it doesn't look like you'll be getting this, at least for nowâ€”but it is good news for any motherboard you want to buy from this point onward, as long as it's a newer generation.
