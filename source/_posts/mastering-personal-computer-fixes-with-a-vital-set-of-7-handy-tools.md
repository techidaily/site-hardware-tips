##  Precision Screwdriver Set

 A precision screwdriver set is required for handling screws when disassembling PC components such as cases, motherboards, and hard drives. These sets contain screwdrivers with various tips, such as Phillips, flathead, hex, and more, ensuring that you don't strip screws or damage delicate components while removing them.

Craig Lloyd / Review Geek

 Also, their magnetic tips prevent tiny screws from dropping and getting lost while unscrewing, and [they are safe to use](https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/transfer-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-apps-to-new-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/). For these reasons, a precision screwdriver set is a must-have in your repair toolkit, whether you're repairing your PC for the first time or planning to build one from scratch.

[iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) is a reputable brand known for offering high-quality precision screw sets. While basic sets start at around $10, investing less than $50 can get you a set with a broader range of tips.

##  Anti-Static Bracelet

 Factors such as low humidity, wearing synthetic clothing, or walking barefoot on a carpet can cause static charge buildup in your body. When handling sensitive PC components like the processor, memory modules, and motherboard during PC repairs, you need to be mindful of the static electricity your body holds.

 These components can only tolerate specific voltage and current levels, and exceeding them can seriously damage them. To mitigate this risk and avoid costly repair or replacement bills, you should invest in an anti-static bracelet, also known as an [anti-static wrist strap](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-reviewing-ingenuity-moto-z2s-intelligent-evolution/) or ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) wrist strap, a device that effectively dissipates any static charge.

 You just need to wear the bracelet around your wrist and attach the other end to a grounded surface, ensuring any static charge is safely dissipated to the ground without damaging anything. This modest investment can help prevent unnecessary repair expenses. [Rosewill](https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Grounding-Alligator-RTK-002-Detachable/dp/B004N8ZQKY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwant-to-do-your-own-pc-repair-make-sure-you-have-these-tools%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a reputable brand offering these bracelets, starting at around $5.

##  Canned Air

![A hand holding can of air duster.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/d58505c9.png) 

[Arnet117/Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/male-hand-holding-compressed-gas-duster-77615479)

 Dust accumulation is often the primary culprit behind numerous PC issues. When it clogs air vents and fans, [it can cause the PC to overheat](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/from-best-to-extraordinary-mondlys-journey-in-german-linguistics/), which then slows down GPU fans and causes performance issues. Hence, the first thing to do when repairing a PC is to [get rid of this dust buildup](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-pantry-to-fame-tiktoks-culinary-stars/).

 For this job, you need canned air. It's a can filled with pressurized gas that blows dust away from your PC parts, like the motherboard, CPU fan, graphics card, and power supply. [Dust-Off](https://www.amazon.com/Dust-Off-DPSXL4A-Electronics-Duster-Compressed/dp/B078539Q3X/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwant-to-do-your-own-pc-repair-make-sure-you-have-these-tools%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a famous brand for this. A single can usually cost between $5 to $10, but you can get a better deal if you buy them in packs.

##  Multimeter

 During PC repairs, you may need to assess various aspects, such as [power supply output voltages](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-in-depth-look-at-vsco-photo-craftsmanship/), continuity of wires or connectors, and the health of motherboard components like resistors, capacitors, and diodes. Likewise, checking other circuit boards is often necessary. A multimeter proves invaluable in these tasks.

 By measuring voltage, current, resistance, and other parameters, you can detect anomalies indicating serious hardware issues and address any electrical problems you encounter when testing different PC sections. Therefore, having a multimeter in your PC repair toolkit is essential.

 Basic multimeters cost less than $50, while units with additional features and higher accuracy can cost up to $100\. [Fluke](https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-101-Multimeter-Equipment-Industrial/dp/B01IB9S6WK/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwant-to-do-your-own-pc-repair-make-sure-you-have-these-tools%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a renowned brand for multimeters.

##  Cotton Swabs

 While compressed air can help eliminate dust from major PC components, certain areas, such as RAM stick contacts, motherboard connectors, slots, and crevices, demand gentle cleaning. Cotton swabs are the recommended product for precisely cleaning these delicate areas of your computer.

 These small sticks feature cotton on both ends, allowing you to effectively remove dust and grime, handle tasks like removing thermal paste residue, or apply fresh paste. Thanks to their soft nature, you avoid the risk of scratching or damaging any delicate PC part, potentially saving you from costly repairs.

 You can purchase a pack of over 100 cotton swabs for less than $5\. While various brands offer these swabs, Q-Tips is well-reputed.

##  Magnetic Parts Tray

 While a screwdriver with a magnetic tip can prevent you from dropping and losing screws and other metal parts during disassembly, it's still important to have something to hold onto them. A magnetic parts tray serves this purpose.

 This small, shallow metal container features a magnetic base that securely holds any metallic part you place inside it, such as nuts and bolts, preventing them from rolling off your workspace or table. Additionally, you can organize different metallic parts separately and in a way that's easy to remember.

 By keeping everything within easy reach and organized, this metallic tray can expedite the repairing process. Moreover, you can move it around your workspace without spilling any of the components it's holding.

 You can find a small tray for less than $10, and even a decent-sized tray or tray set won't cost you more than $20\. [HORUSDY](https://www.amazon.com/HORUSDY-4-Piece-Magnetic-Stainless-Square/dp/B08BWLTK1D/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwant-to-do-your-own-pc-repair-make-sure-you-have-these-tools%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a reputable brands in this niche.

##  Anti-Static Brush

 While Q-Tips and canned air help remove dust and debris, a deeper cleaning requires an anti-static brush. Like anti-static bracelets, these brushes feature bristles designed to remove debris without creating a static charge, which can harm your PC components. This investment can also protect you from significant losses due to hardware failure.

 Before embarking on your first repair or PC building venture, it's important to have the above tools on hand. Except for the multimeter, all other tools are relatively inexpensive. Ensure you acquire all of them and take the time to familiarize yourself with their usage by reading through the manuals, especially if you're new to using them. Lastly, only proceed with PC repairs with proper technical knowledge; otherwise, a simple mistake can lead to significant costs!
