## Discovering High Memory Usage by Applications in Android Phones

Many Android phones have plenty of memory these days, but not everyone wants to shell out the cash for them. Even if you do, you may wonder what apps are eating up RAM. We'll show you how to find out.

 First, we'll need to [enable Android's hidden "Developer Options."](https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/navigating-marvels-team-up-the-truth-behind-the-avengers-ratings/) There are some handy features hidden here, including the ability to see which apps are using the most memory. Get that out of the way before proceeding.

 Next, swipe down once or twice---depending on your phone---from the top of the screen to reveal the full Quick Settings menu, then tap the gear icon.

 That's all there is to it! The apps are ordered by how much memory they use, so the [biggest spenders](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/is-my-xbox-live-account-working-a-quick-look-at-the-service-status-today/) will be at the top of the list. "Android OS," "Android System," and "Google Play Services" will always be towards the top. Scroll down further to find the third-party apps.
