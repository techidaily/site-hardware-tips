## Surface Pro's Revolutionary Shift: From Intel Processors to Snapdragon Chips

Microsoft revealed an updated Surface Pro 10 earlier this year, but it was aimed entirely at business customers. Now, there’s a new Surface Pro for the rest of us, powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon chips.

 Microsoft just revealed the “all-new Surface Pro,” ditching the model numbers that have been used over the past decade (though the product page web address does say “11th edition”). It’s still a Windows tablet with a detachable keyboard and stylus support, like previous models, but under the surface (heh) there are some drastic changes. The [Surface Pro 10](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-pros-playbook-3-ways-to-record-competitive-games/) will remain the recommended option for business customers, at least for now.

 The new Surface Pro ships with either Snapdragon X Elite or Snapdragon X Plus chipsets, instead of the Intel processors used in all previous Surface Pro models (except select 5G variants). It’s also part of the first wave of [Copilot Plus PCs](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), meaning it can run newer AI features in Windows like Recall and more Windows Studio Effects. Microsoft says the new Surface Pro is “90% faster than Surface Pro 9,” though it’s not clear if that is referring to the Snapdragon X Plus model, the Snapdragon X Elite version, or both.

 The rest of the hardware includes a 13-inch touchscreen with an optional OLED panel, two USB 4 Type-C ports, one USB Type-A connector, and support for up to three external 4K displays. There’s also support for Wi-Fi 7, and just like with the previous [Surface Pro 9](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/arabic-basics-for-first-timers/), there will be an integrated 5G option. However, the 5G models won’t be available until “later in 2024,” according to the product page.

 The front and rear-facing cameras have also been overhauled. Microsoft said in a blog post, “The ultra-wide, quad-HD front-facing camera is our best Surface camera ever. AI-powered Windows Studio Effects like Automatic Framing, keep you in focus, even as you move around your space. The 10MP Ultra HD rear-facing autofocus camera supports 4K video so you can capture and edit all on one device.”

 The main catch here is the detachable keyboard. It’s a technical upgrade from previous Surface keyboards, with an optional wireless mode and a built-in slot for the pen, but it’s also significantly more expensive. The keyboard costs $450 with the pen and $350 without the pen. Apple’s [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWR03LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-m4-us-english-white) is $300 for the 11-inch iPads and $350 for 13-inch iPads, which is also too much money, but at least that keyboard doubles as a raised stand and adds another USB Type-C port.

 The new Surface Pro starts at $1,000 for the Snapdragon X Plus model with an LCD screen, and the Snapdragon X Elite version with an OLED screen starts at $1,500\. That doesn’t include the keyboard or stylus pen. You can [buy the Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-pro-11th-edition/8n9t09p96cmj) from Microsoft’s online store, and it should show up at other retailers soon.
