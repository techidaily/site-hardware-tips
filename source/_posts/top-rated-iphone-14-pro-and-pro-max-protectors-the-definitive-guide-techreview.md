What do you prioritize after you purchase the newest iPhone? You probably want to protect your investment with the best iPhone case. One that's slim, durable, and maybe even good for the planet.

Kevin Zhou, CEO and founder of [Repart](https://irepart.com/), a cell phone repair parts manufacturer, wanted a durable case that would safeguard the iPhone 14 from any damage. "Longevity is an aspect I was looking for," Zhou told ZDNET. "I cannot go around searching for phone cases repeatedly, so I settled for an option that would serve me for years."

Sustainable cases last and are made with quality materials. "I chose [a biodegradable case made from cornstarch.](https://www.wavecase.co.uk/shop/p/iphone-14-pro)," Diana Leenders, an Etsy SEO specialist and co-founder of [EtsyGeeks.org](http://etsygeeks.org/), told ZDNET. "It's held up really well with time and has provided adequate protection."

It's also water-resistant -- just wipe the case with a wet cloth to clean it.

While the price is relatively steep at $65, the feel might be worth the cost. Urban Sophistication says this case feels "like your favorite pillow... like the puffiest coat... like a marshmallow." Is anyone else intrigued? 

Urban Sophistication continues to roll out more options. Right now, most colors are compatible with the iPhone 14 Max and Pro Max.

## How did we choose these phone cases?

We considered various factors when analyzing the best iPhone cases on the market. The most important factors are sustainability, durability, affordability, and aesthetic. 

Each case on this list also has a different texture. You would notice a material difference between A Good Company's linseed case and the wheat-based Wave Case. Prices points also vary, especially between the Wave Case and the Zagg Brooklyn Snap -- but the premium vegan leather of the Zagg might be worth the higher cost for you.

## How big is an iPhone 14 Pro? How big is an iPhone 14 Pro Max?

The iPhone 14 Pro Max is larger than the iPhone 14 Pro. Here are the exact measurements:

* **iPhone 14 Pro:** 5.81 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches
* **iPhone 14 Pro Max:** 6.33 x 3.05 x 0.31 inches

## Is it worth upgrading to the iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max?

According to [ZDNET experts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/), the iPhone 14 Pro packs a lot more innovation for the same price as last year.
