## Stunning Design: Satechi Unveils Latest Innovation in Vehicle Wireless Charging Solutions

There are a lot of car mounts with integrated wireless chargers, but not many of them are ready for Qi 2, the new magnetic charging standard already supported by iPhones and eventually coming to Android phones. Thankfully, Satechi now has a magnet car charger with Qi 2 support.

 Satechi, a name that you might be familiar with from other accessories and gadgets, today announced the launch of its latest Qi2 Wireless Car Charger. This new charger boasts the latest [Qi 2 technology](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-fake-following-fiasco-avoiding-illusory-supporters-in-social-media-space/), meaning that if your phone supports Qi 2 charging, it'll hook up magnetically to the back of your phone. It works with all MagSafe-compatible iPhones (iPhone 12 - iPhone 15 series), and whenever Qi 2 appears on Android phones and other devices, it will work with those.

 The charger delivers 15W of power for fast and efficient charging on the road, and it will hold onto your phone securely even as you drive over bumpy roads which might knock it down. Just put your phone on the charger, let the magnets do their job, and forget about it for the length of the trip. You can even use it as a phone stand of sorts while you drive.

 Its upgraded design includes a soft silicone charging puck that safeguards phones from scratches and prevents the puck from cracking over time. The charger also comes equipped with a one-meter USB-C cable and a 25W CLA (Cigarette Light Adapter), so you can plug in your phone directly if needed.

 "Our new Qi2 Wireless Car Charger is a game-changer for anyone who spends a significant amount of time in their car," said a Satechi spokesperson. "With its powerful magnets, sleek design, and fast charging capabilities, it's the perfect accessory for modern drivers who demand both convenience and style."

 You can [buy the Satechi Qi2 Wireless Car Charger](https://satechi.net/products/qi2-wireless-car-charger) starting today for $59.99\. There might not be a lot of non-Apple Qi 2 options right now, but if you have an iPhone, it's a good accessory. Whenever we start seeing more Qi 2 Android phones, you'll be able to use it with those too.
