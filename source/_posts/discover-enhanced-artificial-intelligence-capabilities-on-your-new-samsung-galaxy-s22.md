## Discover Enhanced Artificial Intelligence Capabilities on Your New Samsung Galaxy S22

It's been a long wait, but the One UI 6.1 update is finally rolling out to select smartphones from Samsung's 2022 lineup. This update includes the Galaxy AI suite and Google's popular Circle to Search technology, which have already made their way to newer Samsung devices.

 Five smartphones gain Galaxy AI functionality with the One UI 6.1 updateâ€”the Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22+, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold 4, and the Galaxy Z Flip 4\. Tablets in the Galaxy Tab S8 series are also eligible for Galaxy AI, though I should note that today's One UI 6.1 release is limited to the United States.

 The Galaxy AI suite unlocks a ton of useful functionality, including Live Translate, [Circle to Search](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), Generative Edit, AI-Generated Wallpaper, and Chat Assist. I suggest that you check out our [Galaxy AI rundown](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-instagram-story-tips/) for an explanation of each of these features. You should at least check out Circle to Search, which may be the best of the bunch.

 However, there is a caveat to this rollout. Samsung devices from 2022 will not receive the "Instant Slow-Mo" feature, which uses AI frame generation technology to convert normal videos to slow-motion videos. Future Galaxy AI features may trickle down to older devices, though it probably depends on the amount of processing power required by such features.

 Samsung devices released before 2022 will not gain Galaxy AI functionality. However, this update adds Circle to Search to a selection of Galaxy devices from 2021, specifically the Galaxy S21 lineup, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3\. If you're using a Samsung phone from 2020 or earlier, you're out of luck.

 Note that Galaxy AI features may [cost money](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-stream-efficiency-obs-meets-zoom/) after 2025\. Samsung floated the idea of an AI subscription in January, though this subscription would probably focus on Galaxy AI tools that require cloud processing, such as Generative Edit.

 Your smartphone should ask you to install the One UI 6.1 update. If it doesn't, you can perform a manual update by opening "Settings," heading to "About device," and clicking "Software update." As with all updates, One UI 6.1 may not be immediately available to all users.
