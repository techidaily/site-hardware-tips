## NVMe SSD UpHere M201 Heatsink Review - Exceptional Cooling Performance at an Unbeatable $5 Price

Until recently, cooling for storage was at best an afterthought for most enthusiasts and PC builders ‚Äì it really wasn‚Äôt a concern outside of servers jam-packed full of drives. But current-generation PCIe 5 SSDs can transfer more data faster than ever before, and pushing those speeds can generate a fair bit of extra heat. With these modern drives, not only is some kind of cooling recommended, but it‚Äôs generally a requirement to prevent throttling[or even crashing in some instances](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/other-pcie-50-ssds-are-also-crashing-instead-of-throttling) .

 Over the past few years, cooling companies have released a wide variety of heatsinks and coolers for NVMe SSDs to ensure that they can maintain their maximum speeds. Heatsinks large and small, with or without active fans (and[even liquid cooling solutions](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/teamgroup-t-force-siren-duo-360) ) are now available for NVMe SSDs.

 Our recent NVMe heatsink reviews have focused on the strongest units available on the market, suitable for users with intense storage workloads and high ambient temperatures ‚Äì but the fact is most users don‚Äôt need such strong solutions. In this review, we‚Äôll take a look at UpHere‚Äôs M201 SSD Heatsink, which is an entry-level solution aimed at mainstream users. We‚Äôve recently tested[UpHere‚Äôs C5C Air Cooler](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/air-cooling/uphere-c5c-and-d6sec-air-coolers-review) and found it one of the better low-end coolers on the market.

## Features of UpHere‚Äôs M201 NVMe SSD Heatsink

 **\*Ô∏è‚É£ No compatibility concerns, will fit with any air cooler or dGPU**

 As this heatsink is roughly the same height as a PCI-e slot, it won‚Äôt cause any compatibility issues with other components. Larger NVMe SSD heatsinks often won‚Äôt fit underneath many air coolers due to their size.

UpHere‚Äôs M201 is about as cheap as they come, costing just $4.99 in the U.S.

**\*Ô∏è‚É£ Jagged heatsink design takes advantage of native airflow**

 While the M201 doesn‚Äôt have a fan cooling the heatsink, its jagged design will take advantage of existing airflow in the case. This means that it will perform better in systems using air cooling, if installed in the M.2 slot next to your CPU. Alternatively, this also means that it would perform worse in a bottom side M.2 slot where there is less airflow or when a liquid cooler is installed instead of air cooling.

**\*Ô∏è‚É£ Double-sided SSD support**

 Many of the cheapest M.2 NVMe heatsinks only make contact with the top half, meaning that any NAND placed on the underside is unprotected. UpHere‚Äôs M201 features double-sided protection, ensuring peak performance for both single- sided and double-sided M.2 SSDs.

## What I don‚Äôt like about the UpHere M201

**\*Ô∏è‚É£ Annoying clips during installation**

 The installation of the heatsink isn‚Äôt particularly difficult, but the use of clips between the heatsink‚Äôs halves might make installation difficult for novice users.

## How hot is too hot? Does cooling even matter for an SSD?

 With SSD heatsinks, many will understandably be asking if it really matters. And if you‚Äôre a typical user who mostly just loads a few applications and games, you probably don‚Äôt need an advanced heatsink with a fan. I‚Äôve run a variety of tests, and for common tasks like loading a game or application, you generally don‚Äôt need more than a basic heatsink ‚Äì at least not with current SSDs and workloads.

 If you need heavy-duty cooling for your drives, you probably already know it. This includes users whose workloads are IO-intensive or involve high-resolution video editing.

 We‚Äôre also trying to look to the future here, to an extent. Today‚Äôs common workloads might not need anything more than a basic heatsink, but this may change with[PCIe 6](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/pcie-60-inches-closer-to-arriving-in-the-market-in-2024-alphawave-demonstrates-interoperability) and future standards, which will allow for higher speeds (and probably higher power consumption) in consumer SSDs.

 After consulting storage experts across the industry who work for popular storage brands, I‚Äôve created an IOMeter script that‚Äôs specifically designed to stress an SSD‚Äôs controller and NAND, causing it to reach its maximum temperature (also known as TJ Max). The ambient temperature is maintained at 23 degrees Celsius while these tests are performed. The SSD used is[Teamgroup‚Äôs Z540 SSD](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/teamgroup-cardea-z540-ssd-review) , which is powered by[Phison‚Äôs E26 controller](https://www.phison.com/phocadownload/CES%5F2023%5FPage/ProductBrochure%5FConsumer%5FPS5026-E26%5F12192022.pdf) .

 This test will cause throttling when paired with lower-end heatsinks. For those heatsinks, we‚Äôll be looking at the IOPS of the drive during testing. The more advanced heatsinks and coolers will be capable of keeping the SSD under its peak temperature ‚Äì for these units, we‚Äôll compare the actual temperatures of the TeamGroup Z540 SSD.

 If peak performance in common scenarios like gaming is your only goal, then most basic heatsinks will offer satisfactory performance. However, users with storage-intensive workloads will require a stronger heatsink in order to prevent the SSD‚Äôs performance from throttling. The impact of this potential throttling can vary; lighter loads won‚Äôt be impacted as much, but in the worst-case scenario I tested, I measured a 92% loss of performance without cooling on a PCIe 5.0 SSD.

 You might think that‚Äôs the only aspect to consider when looking at a heatsink, but the thermals of an SSD also have a huge impact on a drive‚Äôs longevity. Much like other electronic components, extreme variations in temperature causes wear and tear, reducing lifespan. Now let's be real here - most users shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about longevity and instead should purchase a drive from a reliable manufacturer, with a good warranty. While this is our general recommendation, there are scenarios where this won‚Äôt apply ‚Äì for instance,if you purchased a refurbished SSD at a discount, you can‚Äôt expect to have a long warranty.

 Finally, there‚Äôs the matter of dealing with the hassle of a warranty. While it is nice to know that a failing drive will be replaced by the manufacturer, why create an environment where such a claim is likely to happen? I‚Äôd argue that it would be wiser to invest $10 or $15 (or just $5 in this instance) into a heatsink to extend the lifespan of your SSD so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about dealing with the paperwork and time involved in processing a warranty claim.

 In theory, if your NVMe SSD arrives with a heatsink from the manufacturer, you shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about a heatsink at all. Most of the heatsinks I‚Äôve seen paired with high-end PCIe 5 SSDs are capable of handling strong thermal loads. However, many drives do not include a heatsink and it would not be wise to run a high-speed PCIe 5 SSD entirely uncooled, as performance will suffer even in common workloads.

 When it comes to heatsinks for SSDs, the important thing to take away here is that it‚Äôs best practice to minimize temperature variations for the health and longevity of your SSD. How strong of a heatsink you‚Äôll need is another matter for debate.

 To test the heatsinks, I‚Äôve created a custom IOMeter script created with input from experts in the industry. I run an initial test of 30 minutes after installing the heatsink to burn it in. After turning the system off and allowing it to cool down, I run another 30-minute test. I‚Äôll repeat the process for verification and if there is no variance, I consider the results accurate. If there is variance, I‚Äôll test the heatsink two more times.

 Tests are performed inside of a real case,[BeQuiet‚Äôs Silent Base 802](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/be-quiet-silent-base-802-review) . I use a 360 mm AIO to avoid having the CPU Cooler potentially impact the results, but there‚Äôs an argument to be made that the smallest heatsinks should be tested under an air cooler. We‚Äôll investigate this further in upcoming reviews to see how much ‚Äì or little ‚Äì this can impact the results of lower-end heatsinks.

All testing is performed with an ambient temperature of 23 C.

## Installation

 The installation of this SSD heatsink isn‚Äôt hard per se, but it isn‚Äôt quite as simple as most others on the market.

 The first step is to take one of the included thermal pads and apply it to the base of the heatsink.

![UpHere M201 SSD Heatsink](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bsGymASMp26QdEBGsjQoSB-320-80.jpg)

 The next step can be slightly frustrating if you aren‚Äôt patient and / or don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll want to take the clip and slide it underneath the grooves shown in the picture above. Make sure the open side of the clip is facing down to maintain proper pressure.
