 With a build volume of 225mm x 225mm x 265mm, you get plenty of workspace. The texture PEI build platform and intelligent segmented heatbed means that the Neptune 4 Pro has excellent part adhesion, meaning you won't need glue to hold your prints in place.  
  
 Coming as a part-built kit, the Neptune 4 Pro is easy to assemble; just a few screws and you are ready to level the print bed. You need to do this manually, and then run a 121-point automated bed level sequence. After finally setting the Z-offset you're good to start printing with a range of filaments.

 Running a branch of the Klipper firmware, the Neptune 4 Pro is much faster than is predecessors, which ran Marlin firmware. The increased speed of the Neptune 4 Pro means that you will need better cooling. Thankfully the Neptune 4 Pro has a huge part cooling fan that resides across the X-axis. There are three fan modes: mute, normal, and sport, with sport being the loudest and most powerful.

 The Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro is a formidable printer that dominates this price-range. Speed, quality and impressive part-cooling makes this a great purchase for all levels of 3D printer enthusiasts.
