## Innovative Keycap Customization for a Fresh Start on Your Keyboard!

Mix up your desk space with some new keycap sets—which are currently BOGO at Drop today!

 Tired of looking at the same old keyboard every day? That may seem like an odd question, but think about it. Many of us use our keyboards all day, every day, for work, school, and gaming. It's good to switch up the look of your workstation every once in a while, but buying a whole new keyboard can be overkill—and expensive if you're using [mechanical keyboards](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/social-sensation-best-insta-stories-effects/).

 One relatively cheap way to change things up is to swap out your keycaps! Maybe you're still using the same set you got with your keyboard, or you have one set you've been using for a while. Better yet, you don't need to swap all the keys out. Why not mix and match instead?

 Mixing and matching keycaps is always a fun experience. You can go through your sets, see which ones complement each other, and create a keyboard that's uniquely yours. Sometimes even something as simple as swapping out the Escape and Enter keys with [some accent colors](https://cannonkeys.com/collections/cannonkeys-keycaps/products/nicepbt-accent-kits) can change the entire look of your board. And if you're like me, you have a bunch of sets just sitting in boxes anyway. Change it up!

 Even if you don't have a keycap collection (yet), you can grab new sets on the cheap if you wait for a sale. Right now, Drop is having a sale on a variety of products on their storefront, including a variety of keycap collections! You can buy one MT3 keycap set and get one free using the code **SUMMERMT3BOGO** at checkout.

 My personal recommendation would be to get a neutral-colored set, such as the [Drop + Mito MT3 9009 PBT Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/mt3-9009-pbt-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=968777), with a set with more striking colors, such as the [Drop + Mito MT3 Pulse Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-mt3-pulse-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=973454), and you can mix and match the colors from there! The code works for base keycap sets (which include all the basic keys), so you'll have plenty of options to choose from. Of course, these aren't the only two sets on sale either, so make sure to [check the sales page](https://drop.com/all-communities/drops/MT3BOGO) to see what's on offer!
