 Assembly is easy; all the tools are in the box, and it comes largely assembled. It takes less than 30 minutes to build, even for a novice.

 The biggest visible change between the Neptune 4 Pro and the 3 Pro is a large fan that sits on the X gantry. These fans are there to rapidly cool your print as the hot end zips along squirting plastic. The fan has multiple settings, including "violent" which turns up the fan speed to 11 and could cool your prints and yourself on a hot summer day.

 The Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro is a formidable printer, and effectively crushes the competition in the sub-$300 price range with wildly fast print speeds and an impressive part cooling system. The lack of a fully automated build platform leveling system stands out as a step backward from the previous generation Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, but the linear rods and increased print speeds will likely make it easy for most users to overlook.
