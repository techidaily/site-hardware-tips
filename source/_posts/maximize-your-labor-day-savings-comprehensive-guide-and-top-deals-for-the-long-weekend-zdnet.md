Labor Day weekend always marks the unofficial end of summer and the beginning of [back-to-school season](https://www.zdnet.com/collection/back-to-school/), routines, and--unfortunately--colder weather. And while we don't want to see summer go away, Labor Day also means a weekend full of deals.

Read on for everything you need to know about this year's Labor Day sales, including all the best deals you can shop this weekend while you're off the clock.

## When do Labor Day deals go live? 

Labor Day is on Monday, Sept. 2, but Labor Day deals have already begun and will last throughout the long weekend. 

## Where can I find Labor Day deals?

We expect Labor Day deals to be available at most major retailers looking to cash in on end-of-summer sales. Retailers such as [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C35f7502d-58d7-488f-a4f8-52f74cd93d05%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Target](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Costco](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.costco.com/), and more are offering deals, discounts, and extra savings across home, tech, and more.

## What will be on sale for Labor Day? 

You can save on everything from [smart home devices](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/best-smart-home-device/) to [TVs](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-tv/), [tablets](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablet/), [lawn and outdoor gear](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/yard-outdoors/best-robot-mower/), and more. In addition, keep an eye out for discounts on bigger items like appliances as well as deals on top brands like Apple and Samsung. 

## How long will Labor Day deals last? 

Like Memorial Day or other holiday sales, deals usually last a bit after the holiday itself, but only for a few days. There will likely still be lingering deals after Monday, Sept. 2, but most of the good deals will expire after the three-day weekend is over, so if you're eyeing something, buy it while you still have the discount.
