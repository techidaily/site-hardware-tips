## AMD's Cutting-Edge Ryzen 7 7800X3D: Zen 5 Architecture Leaves Zen 4 Gaming Flagship Behind with a Staggering 23% Performance Boost

Third-party reviews of the Ryzen 9 9900X have begun to crop up, giving us our first authentic look at the actual performance of AMD's new[Zen 5](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-deep-dives-zen-5-ryzen-9000-and-strix-point-cpu-rdna-35-gpu-and-xdna-2-architectures) architecture. A Ryzen 9 9900X review by SaddyTech on YouTube has revealed that the 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X beast doesn't have the chops to outperform AMD's current[Ryzen 7 7800X3D](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-cpu-review) , one of the[best CPUs](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html) around. The Zen 4 chip with 3D V-Cache outperformed the Ryzen 9 9900X in gaming at 1080p and 1440p resolutions by up to 23%.

 SaddyTech tested_Alan Wake 2_ ,_Total War Warhammer_ ,_City Skylines 2_ ,_Call of Duty: Warzone 2_ ,_CS: GO 2_ ,_Cyberpunk 2077_ ,_Fortnite_ ,_Hogwarts Legac_ y,_Starfield_ , and_The Last of Us: Part 1_ .

 Virtually all titles showed favor toward the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. At 1080p,_City Skylines 2_ demonstrated the highest performance lead, boasting a 23% lead in favor of the older 7800X3D._Cyberpunk 2077_ ,_The Last of Us: Part 1_ ,_Fortnite_ , and_Hogwarts Legacy_ showed very similar behavior as well, with Ryzen 7 7800X3D boasting anywhere between a 13% and 18% higher performance.

 At 1440p, the same behavior from all the games was present but at lower margins, which is inevitable given the higher resolution. 4K squeezed margins down even further to the point where both chips were performing virtually identically in most titles, except for_City Skylines 2_ , which is known to be a very CPU-intensive game. The higher resolutions put more work on the GPU and less strain on the CPU.

 SaddyTech's gaming[benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark) confirm AMD's previous statements about Ryzen 9000 not beating the Ryzen 7000 X3D processors in gaming. This is not a surprise and a trend that started with the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. For instance, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, despite being a generation old, was still able to outperform the Ryzen 9 7950X flagship by 8% in our testing.

 3D V-Cache continues to be AMD's magic pill for incredibly efficient gaming performance, providing a generational improvement in performance for chips that take advantage of it. We must wait until the Ryzen 9000 X3D launches before Zen 5 officially dethrones Zen 4 with 3D V-Cache in gaming.
