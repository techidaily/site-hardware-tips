## Discover the Best Gaming PC Power Supplies: Our Top Picks for 2Amoy 2024

Your PC's power supply (aka PSU) plays a significant role in determining your system's reliability, depending on its performance. So it would be best if you were careful when picking the right PSU for your system. The best power supply should also have features to save your system's parts (including the power supply itself) if something goes wrong with your electricity supply or other components. If it doesn't, it's clearly not the best power supply and is putting your other expensive PC parts at risk.

 Of course, you'll also have different concerns depending on whether your power supply will be pushing a monster mining rig, an always-churning workstation, or a basic productivity or[gaming PC](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-gaming-pcs) . We’ll help you find the best power supply for your next desktop PC below.

 Finally, one of the significant changes that the[ATX12V v3.0 spec](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-atx-v3-psu-standard) brings is the addition of a 12+4 pin PCIe connector to every PSU with more than 450W max power. This means that PSUs lacking this connector won't be compatible with new GPU generations and will soon be rendered obsolete.

## Quick Power Supply Shopping Tips

 Why you can trust Tom's Hardware  Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.[Find out more about how we test](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-we-test) .

**Determine wattage requirements.** You don't need to purchase much more potential power capacity (wattage) than you’ll ever use. You can calculate roughly how much power your new or upgraded system will draw from the wall and look for a capacity point that satisfies your demands. Several power supply sellers have calculators that will give you a rough estimate of your system's power needs. You can find a few below:

* [Cooler Master Power Calculator](http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/)
* [Seasonic Wattage Calculator](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator)
* [MSI PSU Calculator](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584492&xcust=tomshardware%5Fus%5F1410784923467596564&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msi.com%2Fcalculator&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomshardware.com%2Freviews%2Fbest-psus%2C4229.html)
* [be quiet! PSU Calculator](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-2475315634784480134%26murl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fimages10.newegg.com%252FBizIntell%252Ftool%252Fpsucalc%252Findex.html)
* [Newegg PSU Calculator](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-6577463392882669177%26murl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fimages10.newegg.com%252FBizIntell%252Ftool%252Fpsucalc%252Findex.html)

**Consider upcoming GPU power requirements.** Although the[best graphics cards](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html) are usually more power-efficient than previous generations, their power consumption increases overall. This is why the latest 12+4 pin connector that the upcoming generation graphics cards will use will provide up to 600 W of power. Currently, a pair of PCIe 6+2 pin connectors on dedicated cables are officially rated for up to 300W, and three of these connectors can deliver up to 450W safely. You should also add the up to 75W that the PCIe slot can provide in these numbers.

 What troubles today's power supplies is not the maximum sustained power consumption of a GPU but its power spikes, and this is why various manufacturers suggest strong PSUs for high-end graphics cards. If the PSU's over current and over power protection features are conservatively set, the PSU can shut down once the graphics card asks for increased power, even for very short periods ( nanoseconds range). This is why EVGA offers two different OPP features in its G6 and P6 units, called firmware and hardware OPP. The first triggers at lower loads, in the millisecond range, while the latter triggers at higher loads that last for some nanoseconds. This way, short power spikes from the graphics card are addressed without shutting down the system.

 If you add the increased power demands of modern high-end CPUs, you can quickly figure out why strong PSUs are necessary again. Please look at our [GPU Benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html) and[CPU Benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html) hierarchies to see how each of these chips perform relative to each other.

**Check the physical dimensions of your case** before buying. If you have a standard ATX case, whether or not it is one of the[best PC cases](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-pc-cases,4183.html) , an ATX power supply will fit. But many higher-wattage PSUs are longer than the typical 5.5 inches. So you'll want to be sure of your cases' PSU clearance. If you have an exceptionally small or slim PC case, it may require a less typical (and more compact) SFX power supply. We have picks for this form factor below as well.

 For more on this subject, see our[A Basic Guide To Motherboard, Case, and Power Supply Form Factors](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/pc-form-factor-basics) feature.

**Consider a modular power supply.** If your case has lots of room behind the[motherboard](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-motherboards) , or your[chassis](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pc-chassis-definition,37651.html) doesn't have a window or glass side, you can cable-wrap the wires you don't' need and stash them inside your rig. But if the system you're' building doesn't' have space for this, or there is no easy place to hide your cable mess, it's' worth paying extra for a modular power supply. Modular PSUs let you only plug in the power cables you need and leave the rest in the box.

 Of the two variants of Corsair's CX450, the Great Wall version is more efficient than CWT's, especially under light loads, and has a more efficient 5VSB rail. On the other side, it has a more-aggressive fan profile, so its noise output is increased. In the US market, you will only find the CWT version, which is made in Vietnam instead of China, so it avoids the tariffs and keeps its price tag low.

**Read:** [Corsair CX450 Review](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-cx450-psu,5678.html)

**Alternate Best Cheap Power Supply:** [Corsair VS450](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-vs450-power-supply,6076.html)

 Another decent alternative if your budget is low, you need more than 500W of capacity, and you aren't that concerned about efficiency or some fan noise under load is the [Corsair VS650](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-vs650-psu,6017.html) . It won't win any performance awards, but it gets the job done without much in the way of frills or fuss, for less than $50\.

 The XPG Core Reactor with 650W max power can achieve higher overall performance than the two hottest picks in this category, the Corsair RM650x, and the Seasonic Focus Plus Gold, with similar capacity. It also has a silent operation, thanks to the relaxed fan profile, despite its compact dimensions. The build quality is high, and the provided warranty meets the competition's offerings. Finally, the two EPS connectors provide compatibility with the high-end mainboard, but they should be installed on dedicated cables—all in all, an excellent power supply.

 The EVGA 850 G7 is one of the best 850W units available on today's market. The Corsair RM850x (2021) is close in performance and has an advantage in noise output, while the 850 G6 loses notably in performance but achieves a significant win in noise output. The performance FSP delivered out of such a compact platform is impressive. We can't stop thinking, though, about the improvement in noise output with a larger PCB and cooling fan. Downsizing high-capacity PSUs at that degree comes at a cost, of increased noise output, under harsh conditions.

[MSI](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar) has a strong entry in the high-end category, with the MEG Ai1000P PCIe 5, which as its code name implies comes with a 12VHPWR connector. This is a true ATX 3.0-ready PSU, able to keep up with the demands of the new generation GPUs and most likely with the upcoming ones, too, since the RTX 4090 doesn't require an ATX 3.0 or PCIe 5.0-ready PSU to operate correctly. It just needs a powerful unit, especially if you plan to push its power limit up to 600 watts.

 The[Thermaltake](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/thermaltake) Toughpower GF3 1350W achieves high overall performance in almost all sections. On top of that, this PSU is ATX v3.0 and PCIe 5.0 ready, so it comes with a 12VHPWR connector out of the box, supporting NVIDIA's newest GPUs without the need for adapters.

 We waited years for a competitor to dethrone Corsair's AX1500i, and in the end it was another Corsair power supply to post higher overall performance. The Corsair AX1600i is the best PSU that money can buy today, period. It offers top performance in all areas and uses an innovative platform, which provides a glimpse at the future of power supply design.

 The use of a cutting-edge PFC circuit in combination with a fully digital platform seems to be the key for record-setting performance. Besides its super efficiency, the AX1600i also offers great load regulation, amazing transient response, a long hold-up time, and unparalleled ripple suppression. Moreover, the great benchmark results are accompanied by quiet operation, enabled by a relaxed fan profile and a high-quality FDB fan. Using the Corsair Link software, you're able to choose between three fan modes: performance, balanced, and quiet.

 The Corsair SF750 is the strongest and one of the best SFX power supplies that money can get you today. If you want so much power out of such a small PSU and you can afford its stiff price, there is no other option. It can easily support a potent gaming system and thanks to the couple of EPS connectors that it has, and is compatible with high-end mainboards that need more juice in the CPU's area.

 If you don't need more than one graphics card connector, you should consider the top-notch SF600 Platinum instead and save yourself some serious money. Corsair has set the so high in the SFX market that even SFX pioneer SilverStone, doesn't have, for the moment at least, a competing 750W SFX model in its portfolio.

 The SX1000 is the strongest small form factor PSU on the market today, and in reality, it is way stronger than its paper specs since we pushed it up 1480W. This is 148% above its nominal capacity! Enhance, the OEM behind this platform delivered a solid unit to SilverStone, with quite good build quality and top-notch parts.

 This is also shown by the provided warranty, which at five years is pretty long, given this unit's insane power density score. In other words, the SX1000 is a small, only in dimensions, power factory, able to support everything you throw at it.
