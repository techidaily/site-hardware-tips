## Production of Fitbit Wearables Halted Forever

"Pixel Watches are our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit,” a Google spokesperson revealed in an interview. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, and except for two watches in 2022, the company has not released a smartwatch since. After two years of no new watch launches from Fitbit, its parent company confirmed that the Pixel Watch will absorb that department.

 The Fitbit team will now work on the [Pixel Watch](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-6-effortless-steps-to-add-social-media-live-content-online/), ending the almost decade-old line of Fitbit smartwatches. Sandeep Waraich, the director of Pixel wearable products, confirmed as much when he told _Engadget_, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio.” The original Fitbit team will contribute its sensor and data expertise and Google will bring its AI tech into the mix. Commenting on the AI tech, Waraich said Google is offering its “advanced models that otherwise probably externally weren't readily available.”

[Fitbit](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-perfecting-your-lol-recordings/)and Fitbit Premium apps will continue to be included in the Pixel Watch experience. These apps, powered by Google’s AI, can analyze your recorded activity and create hyper-personalized workouts. But Google clarified that it’s not going to relegate Fitbit to an app on the watch. “It's not an app in Pixel Watch. It's deeply integrated at a system level,” the Google spokesperson explained.

 Beyond the Pixel Watch, Fitbit will continue working on its hugely popular line of low-profile trackers. These trackers have a minimalist design and have an extremely long battery life. For example, the Fitbit Inspire 3 can last up to 10 days on a single charge. "Trackers is where users clearly tell us they want something discreet. They want longer battery life, they want a simple experience and we are very proud of our Inspire line," Waraich added.

 While it’s the end of the line for the Fitbit watch series, the Fitbit apps and trackers will continue for the foreseeable future.
