## Seamlessly Connect and Use Several Computers with Intel'n Thunderbolt Share Innovation

Thunderbolt is important if you want to connect large external monitors, external GPUs, high-speed storage, or multiple monitors, but not much else. Intel is trying to change that with Thunderbolt Share, a new way to use the technology for multi-device setups and device migrations.

 Intel has just unveiled Thunderbolt Share, which Intel says will greatly change the way you use your peripherals across multiple PCs. Thunderbolt Share leverages the lightning-fast [Thunderbolt technology](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-the-elite-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7plus-and-its-unmatched-android-performance/) to enable seamless sharing of screens, keyboards, mice, storage, and files between two PCs. It's an innovation that comes as a response to the growing trend of multi-PC usage, especially prevalent among content creators and gamers. Thunderbolt Share simplifies tasks like transferring files between PCs, migrating data to a new computer, and sharing peripherals, all while ensuring top-notch security.

 From what we can see in promotional images, it's as simple as plugging a Thunderbolt cable between both systems (with both systems being compatible with Thunderbolt, of course). From there, they will work seamlessly together. You can share files between the computers, and if you happen to have any peripherals connected to the computer, you'll be able to use them across both PCs. Intel says that the software connections via a Thunderbolt monitor, Thunderbolt dock, or directly between two Thunderbolt-enabled PCs.

 Thunderbolt Share boasts hardware-based security measures, including Intel VT-d Data Protection and user access control through Windows password-locked screens. Additionally, the connection is exclusive to the Thunderbolt network and comes with network-level protection via built-in Windows or any other firewall.

 Thunderbolt Share sounds a bit like the [Target Disk Mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-mac-computers-target-disk-mode-mchlp1443/mac) on Mac computers, but that only works with one of the devices booted into a special recovery mode. This is usable with both computers working normally.

 The software is compatible with select new Thunderbolt-enabled PCs and accessories, and it works with all Thunderbolt 4 or Thunderbolt 5 computers running on the Windows operating system. Thunderbolt Share is set to ship in 2024 with select PCs and accessories, while a preview version is now available to download, although your mileage might vary with that one in terms of compatibility.
