## Unlock Exclusive Premium Capabilities on Your Roku Device at No Cost - Discover How Here![ZDNET]

Roku

Roku just announced a new feature called "Backdrops," which transforms your TV into a canvas. Like on the popular [Frame TV from Samsung](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/samsung-frame-tv-2024-vs-2023-comparing-the-key-differences/) and other alternatives, this free feature will showcase artwork and photography while the set is not actively showing content.

Roku says the catalog will include thousands of curated works, including famous classics, wide-ranging museum collections, and abstract designs.

You'll be able to create a gallery of your favorite art or cycle photos from your own collection. Pre-generated galleries will also be available, including certain artists and museums. Paintings will include the artist's name, the year the artist created it, and a brief description. Roku says galleries will evolve as pieces are added over time.

Backdrops will be available via your TV's settings menu or the Backdrops app on your set, automatically appearing once the feature is available. You can click the power button, start Backdrops manually through the app, or use your voice to start showing works. Settings are available to adjust the brightness of Backdrops to match the ambient light in a room and to choose how long the TV shows each image (from 10 seconds to a whole day).

**Also: [This Sony Bravia is my pick for the best TV for the money in 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/this-sony-bravia-is-my-pick-for-the-best-tv-for-the-money-in-2024-and-its-on-sale-for-labor-day/)**

Since other sets with this feature like The Frame have anti-glare screens, the artwork feature can look almost identical to an actual canvas. Given that the quality of Roku TVs varies, it's tough to tell if Backdrops will have that same quality. Still, it's a nice addition that should add new life to your television.

The rollout will happen over the next few weeks, starting with Roku-branded TVs and [third-party Roku TV models](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-roku-tvs/#link={). Later in the fall, Roku streaming players and stream bars will get Backdrops.
