## Enhance Noise-Free Performance with Adaptable PC Enclosures & Shining Ventilation Fans From Be Quiet

German PC component manufacturer[be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/) brought a[new glass case](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/be-quiet-shadow-base-800-fx) series and updated its Light Wings illuminated case fans to[Computex 2024](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex) . The latest cases are highly configurable “[fish tank](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/new-msi-case-combines-fish-tank-style-design-and-back-plug-compatibility-mag-pano-m100r-pz-will-retail-for-around-dollar100) ” designs that are usable in three orientations for showcasing your PC just the way you want.

 Be quiet! introduced the Light Base 600 and Light Base 900 cases. These include fully windowed front and side panels allowing a gorgeous panoramic view of your gaming rig’s components, with the power supply, storage drive, and cables neatly hidden away in a separate chamber.

 These cases aren’t run-of-the-mill PC enclosures since they can be used in three different orientations. You can set them up like a traditional tower or invert them, switching the feet from the bottom to the top of the case. You can also position the case horizontally, placing the glass on the top and front. The back of the case offers support for your motherboard’s back I/O plate.

 Be quiet! told Tom’s Hardware that the company would even provide[3D print files](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/g-code-modify-3d-print-files) for mounts for the case’s feet so that owners could make custom designs for their cases.

 The Light Base 900 DX is the standard version of the case, shipping without fans. It has ample space for up to two 420mm radiators and includes a 1.5-meter addressable RGB (ARGB) light strip for customizing lighting effects. The Light Base 900 FX adds four[Light Wings](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/be-quiet-fx-coolers-case) LX 140mm PWM fans to maximize your lighting and cooling.
