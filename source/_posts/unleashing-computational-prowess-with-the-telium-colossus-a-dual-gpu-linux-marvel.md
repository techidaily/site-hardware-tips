## Unleashing Computational Prowess with The Telium Colossus – A Dual-GPU Linux Marvel

System76 sells many desktops and laptops built to run Linux. The company has now revealed its new high-powered Linux desktop, the Thelio Mega.

 There are many different System76 Thelio desktop computers, built for everything from desktop productivity work to advanced graphics rendering and AI workloads. The Thelio Mega is the highest-end model, initially sold as “The world’s fastest quad-GPU deep learning system,” and System76 has now updated it with newer hardware and enhanced cooling to prevent [thermal throttling](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/leading-titles-to-unlock-on-google-play-pass-a-ranking-of-the-8-greatest-games/). As with the company’s other computers, it’s built to run Ubuntu LTS or Pop!\_OS Linux, but Windows and most other Linux distributions should work too.

 The new Thelio Mega can be configured with one of several AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7000 series processors, from the 16-core 7955WX to the 96-core 7995WX. There are two GPU slots—the base model has a single AMD Radeon RX 7600, or you can order it with various NVIDIA RTX cards. The desktop is sold with up to 512GB RAM, two 8TB NVMe drives, an additional 32TB SATA SSD, and an optional Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth card.

 This is _not_ a computer for standard productivity work or gaming. The Thelio Mega is intended for dual-GPU workloads, such as artificial intelligence training, deep learning workloads, and scientific computing, with two separate cooling systems to keep everything running at peak performance. The storage, memory, and graphics cards can also be upgraded as easily as any other pre-built tower PC. This model has a new I/O shield that should also make motherboard upgrades simple.

 The Thelio Mega uses a similar case design as the other Thelio desktops from System76, with a rigid aluminum frame, a woodgrain (or solid color) stripe running down the front, and an “arcade-style” power button.

 You can [order the Thelio Mega](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mega) from System76 at a starting price of $5,999\. However, the company’s [other Thelio desktops](https://system76.com/desktops) are a better (and much more affordable) fit for typical productivity and gaming tasks. System76 also sells some Linux laptops, like the [Gazelle](https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/the-casual-entrants-handbook-for-tiktok-lives/) and [Adder](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-mastering-screen-sharing-on-windows-11-via-zoom-for-2024/).
