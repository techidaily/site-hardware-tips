Portable battery packs have revolutionized power. Forget noisy, smelly gasoline generators or trailing extension cables; these packs are a convenient way to carry power on the go. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Bluetti AC70 With a battery capacity of 768Wh, this power station is perfect for powering your important devices, whether you are off-grid or suffering a power outage.

Power stations come in all shapes and sizes, from small devices that can easily fit into a backpack to large units that must be transported on wheels. I prefer something in the middle -- a power station that's big enough to power heavy loads for extended periods but small enough to be easily carried around.

When testing a power station for a review, there are a few key aspects I examine.

First, I verify that the device lives up to the claims made on its spec sheet, which, for power stations, includes the battery capacity and the loads the device can handle. I'm also keen to see how the power station copes with loads exceeding its rated capacity, looking for it to shut down gracefully rather than spit, spark, and make a ruckus.

The AC70 passed all my tests with flying colors. It's a well-made, well-engineered unit that delivers exactly what it promises.

I am particularly impressed by the device's longevity design. Bluetti has incorporated LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries into this power station, which are renowned for their durability. The cells in this unit are rated for 3,000 recharge cycles before they need to be replaced, significantly outperforming the typical 500 to 800 recharge cycles of standard Lithium-Ion batteries.

The unit can be charged from an AC outlet, solar panels, or a vehicle's 12V outlet. 

The front of the AC70 is simple yet functional, with an easy-to-read display and only three buttons.

Safety, particularly with regard to heat management, is a primary concern. While most power stations handle heat well, some are hot garbage. I expect the power stations from a premium brand like Bluetti to be free from safety concerns, and the AC70 did not disappoint.

Durability is also a crucial aspect of my testing. Despite the challenges in standardizing real-world testing, I expose all power stations to rigorous conditions over several weeks. This rigorous testing includes extensive use, transportation in cars and trucks, and deliberate drops onto hard surfaces to evaluate durability.

I'm particularly concerned about the unit's overall integrity. I'm not looking to deliberately break the pack, but I want to know if bits of plastic or components with part numbers on them come loose and start rattling inside the device.

Once again, the AC70 excelled, passing all durability tests.

Despite weighing in at almost 23 lbs, the built-in molded handle is comfortable enough for carrying the unit for extended periods.

Finally, there's usability. I look for controls that are easy to use, accompanied by a display that shows all the necessary information without being cluttered or confusing. 

The AC70 excels in this area as well. Its bright and clear display, complemented by just three backlit buttons, perfectly balances simplicity and functionality.

For me, the AC70 is the perfect "Goldilocks" power station. While I own larger units, ideal for powering substantial off-grid setups, and smaller ones, suited for day trips, the AC70 strikes the ideal balance. It's sufficiently portable for easy transportation but has enough capacity to meet the needs of a small group for several days. I've relied on the power station to charge my smartphone, cameras, drones, and laptops efficiently.

The AC70's versatility is notably enhanced by its wide array of charging options, which include AC input, solar, and 12V DC. I've found that charging the station from a car's 12V outlet is particularly efficient for keeping the unit charged, as long as you avoid letting the battery drain too much. This feature ensures the pack doesn't require an extensive recharge period, which could be inconvenient during travel.

Additionally, Bluetti offers an app for controlling the advanced features of its power stations, such as adjusting the charging speed or enabling eco mode. While I prefer the tactile feedback of physical buttons, which is a nod to my old-fashioned preferences, I acknowledge the appeal and convenience that smartphone control brings to many users.

## ZDNET's buying advice

Given the high cost of power stations, the significant amount of power they store, and the dire consequences of battery malfunctions, I strongly advise investing in a high-quality unit. My experiences with substandard products from obscure brands have underscored the importance of choosing power stations from premium, well-established brands.

**Also: [This power station has an irreplaceable emergency feature](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/this-power-station-has-an-irreplaceable-emergency-feature/)**

Bluetti stands out as one of these reputable brands, and the [AC70](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CLG6FYLQ%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3d51d223-99a8-4ab9-afb7-7e63198f1cbe%7Cdtp&dtb=1) exemplifies its commitment to quality. Given its performance and portability, I can see this power station accompanying me on many adventures during 2024 and beyond.
