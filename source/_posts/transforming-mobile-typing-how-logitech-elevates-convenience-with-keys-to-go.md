## Transforming Mobile Typing: How Logitech Elevates Convenience With Keys-To-Go ^

Are you in need of an obsessively slim portable keyboard? Logitech is now launching Keys-To-Go 2, a wireless keyboard that's less than half an inch thick.

 The [original Keys-To-Go](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Super-Slim-Super-Light-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B08K3SCWGH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003522&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitechs-keys-to-go-2-debut%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) keyboard launched about a decade ago. Since then, it's received several small revisions, but it hasn't changed in any significant way. Keys-To-Go 2 retains the vibe of its predecessor, but it also makes some substantial leaps in terms of design and usability, so it's considered a true second-generation product.

 While the original Keys-To-Go had a squarish design (and looked kind of like a toy), Keys-To-Go 2 is shaped more like a traditional keyboard. It's long and rectangular, and it doesn't use a monotone color scheme, so the keys actually stand out a bit. There's also a flippable top cover attached to the Keys-To-Go 2\. This top cover isn't rigid, so it can't act as a kickstand, but it provides protection during travel and gives the keyboard a slight typing angle.

Close 

 Size-wise, the Keys-To-Go 2 measures 9.8 inches (250mm) long, 4.1 inches (105mm) narrow, and 0.34 (8.77mm) inches thick. It's about the same length as its predecessor, but it's significantly more narrow and rectangular. However, the new model is 0.10 inches thicker than the original Keys-To-Go. I'd say that this is a fair trade-off for the top cover. And if you lay the top cover out flat, Keys-To-Go 2 magically becomes just 0.17 inches (4.57mm) thick!

 Plus, like other Logitech keyboards, the Keys-To-Go 2 supports Logi Options+ customization and can connect to three devices at a time. Dedicated keys at the top of the keyboard allow you to quickly switch your device connection so you can hop between multiple computers, a tablet and a smartphone, or whatever combination of devices you need.

 While I wish that this keyboard's top cover was rigid enough to hold a phone or tablet, slimness is clearly the goal here. An iPad with a [MOFT kickstand](https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Tablet-Stand-Adhesive-Version/dp/B07Z4TRG3V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003522&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitechs-keys-to-go-2-debut%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and a Keys-To-Go 2 keyboard would take up very little space in a bag.

 Note that this keyboard uses coin-cell batteries to achieve its ultra-slim size. These batteries are user-replaceable, and the batteries supposedly last for up to 36 months at a time, but some customers may prefer a rechargeable keyboard or one that runs on AAAs. (For reference, the original Keys-To-Go is rechargeable via Micro USB.)

 The [Logitech Keys-To-Go 2](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards.html) will be available by the end of the month for $80\. It's compatible with all major desktop and mobile operating systems, and customers can choose between a Universal or Apple key layout at checkout (the Apple option uses the typical Mac keyboard layout). Just know that Keys-To-Go 2 can only connect over the Bluetooth LE protocol—there's no wired connectivity, and if a device doesn't support Bluetooth LE, it won't work with this keyboard. Customers in the U.S. get a one-year limited warranty, while Europeans get a two-year limited warranty.
