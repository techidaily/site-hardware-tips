 A gaming PC is one of the most flexible ways to play games, with options to upgrade and pick just the parts you need. There's plenty to keep in mind when buying a gaming PC: power, size, components. and what resolution you want to play at. If all you need is to play a few AAA titles at 1080p, you may not need a high-end CPU and graphics card.

 But if you want to play at 1440p or 4K, then you need to start thinking about saving more for your rig. CPU horsepower is also tied to gaming acumen, but branching out into anything much over a quad-core processor will primarily see performance gains in multi-threaded workloads such as video processing, rendering and encoding, not games.  
  
 Intel released its 14th Gen "Raptor Lake Refresh" processors earlier this year, including the[Core i9-14900K, Core i7-14700K and Core i5-14600K](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review) . In our recent testing, we've found that AMD's 7000-series X3D chips are still the most powerful for gaming.  
  
 And in July, AMD is[set to launch its Zen 5-powered Ryzen 9000 processors](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-announces-zen-5-ryzen-9000-processors-launches-in-july-four-new-ryzen-9-7-and-5-processors-with-a-16-ipc-improvement) , which the company claims will deliver a 16% increase in instructions per cycle over the previous generation. But the X3D models, likely to be the most interesting for gamers, are expected to arrive at a later date.

 We'll jump into our tested picks for best prebuilt gaming PCs directly below. But if you want more advice about how to shop and specific things to look for, our buying advice follows our top gaming PC picks.

_**Best Mid-range gaming PC**_

 The iBuyPower Y60 is a strong mid-range gaming desktop with plenty of room to grow. It comes in the beautiful (but large) Hyte Y60 case to show off your components, and we appreciate that you can get it for 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage for a price that isn't crazy. It also offers a 240 mm liquid cooler, which some PCs in this price range don't include.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Exceptional performance

+

Quiet operation

+

Top-notch build quality

+

Two-year warranty

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

Expensive with RTX 4090

\-

No RGB lighting on RTX 4090 as tested

 Buying a gaming PC may be easier than building one, but perhaps the biggest benefit of the Corsair Vengeance i7500 is that it feels like one you built yourself. The build starts in a[Vengeance 4000D mid-tower case](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-4000x-4000d-airflow-review) and is built to excellent standards.  
  
 Our review system, with an Intel Core i9-14900K and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 from Palit, offered top-notch performance. And while it's pricey at that configuration, the system is backed by a two-year warranty, rather than the one-year system you see on many prebuilt systems in big box stores.  
  
 Because this PC is built entirely from aftermarket parts, you can customize it to your heart's content. No proprietary parts here!  
  
 There were very few downsides, beyond the expense. But RGB-lovers be warned - our review unit's GPU didn't come with colorful lighting, which you kind of expect on something that expensive, like it or not.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Classy case

+

Front USB-C port

+

240 mm liquid cooling

+

Includes a decent keyboard and mouse

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

Large for a mid-tower

\-

Wi-Fi 6, not Wi-Fi 6E

 The iBuyPower Y60 is a strong mid-range performer with some bumped-up specs that will serve you well in the future. It's slightly pricer than some similar desktops, but it comes with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, which will let you store plenty of games and will serve you with demanding apps in the future.  
  
 You get a classy case — the Hyte Y60 — with this prebuilt, which gives you a wrap-around window to your components and a vertically-mounted GPU. While the motherboard doesn't have a USB Type-C port on the rear, there is one on the case.  
  
 Other desktops we tested in this range used air coolers that didn't impress. While liquid cooling isn't a must, the 240 mm liquid cooler in this case was quieter than on some competitors.  
  
 There are some downsides, namely in networking. This system uses Wi-Fi 6, which is getting a bit old as a standard. Some gamers may want to plug in Ethernet (always a best practice, if you can), particularly for big game downloads.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Liquid-cooled CPU and GPU

+

Very quiet

+

Top-end performance

+

Case feels premium

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

Very large

\-

 Swing-out doors have very little ground clearance

 If you're looking for the best of the best, the[MSI](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar) Infinite RS 13th delivers top-of-the-line performance, as long as you're willing to pay for it. Between the 13th Gen Intel Core i9 and a liquid-cooled Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, this system delivers awesome performance, while still being quiet and upgradeable down the line.  
  
 All of the parts are standard, and the case (the MSI Prospect 700RL) is roomy. In fact, for some it may be too roomy! But it can fit the two radiators and nine fans that made this system all but silent in our testing.  
  
 A keyboard and mouse are included, though you'll likely want to get something a bit nicer.  
  
 In our testing, we got some incredible performance out of the Infinite. If you value smooth gameplay and upgradeability out of your prebuilt and will sacrifice room on or under your desk, this is the one to consider.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Strong build quality

+

Fairly affordable starting price

+

Neatly, professionally built

+

No bloatware

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

Needs more dust protection

\-

SSD is slow

 A lot of the gaming PCs we test are top-of-the-line, top-of-budget machines. But it doesn't always have to be that way. We were impressed by the Maingear MG-1 Silver, largely because it's a mid-range system that doesn't feel like you're getting much less.  
  
 The chassis still feels fairly premium, though it could use some more dust filters. It has impeccable cable management, and all of the parts are name-brand, giving you ample room to upgrade later on. And there's no bloatware on the system, so you don't have to spend time uninstalling lots of junk before you get to gaming.  
  
 The only component we had issue with was the Solidigm P41 Plus in our review unit, which was sluggish at 489.65 MBps. The motherboard in our unit did have room for another SSD, however.  
  
 We tested the Shroud Edition of the Maingear MG-1 Silver, which comes with special edition magnetic faceplates. That adds an extra $100 to the $1,149 starting price, so unless you're a big fan of Shroud, the esports gamer and Twitch streamer, stick to the regular version, which is otherwise identical and spend that money on games.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Powerful gaming performance

+

Lots of ports on the front

+

 Alienware finally moved to 240 mm AIO cooling

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

 Proprietary motherboard and server-style PSU make upgrading harder

\-

 At this price, you should get entirely SSD storage

 The Alienware Aurora R15's biggest updates are all about cooling. Alienware parent[Dell](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/dell) has added in a 240 mm radiator, finally moving on from a 120 mm cooler, which should allow for much better CPU performance. There is also more ventilation on the side, and this all made for a quieter PC to our ears.  
  
 It's not much of a surprise that with an Intel Core i9-13900KF and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the Aurora plowed through our benchmarks measuring gaming and productivity performance.  
  
 On the one hand, we really like how many ports are accessible on the front of the Aurora, including three USB Type-A ports, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The downside is that Alienware is using a proprietary motherboard to achieve that, making it difficult to fully upgrade the system in the future.  
  
 The GPU, RAM and CPU are accessible on our model, and there's room for additional storage. (Our review unit was maxed out, so there wouldn't be much of a reason to make many changes outside of storage anytime soon).  
  
 For those who want Alienware's latest chassis, we also recently reviewed the[Aurora R16](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/alienware-aurora-r16) , which is smaller but comes in more limited configurations.

#### Reasons to buy

+

Standard parts allow for upgrades

+

Lots of ports on the front

+

Strong gaming performance

#### Reasons to avoid

\-

RAM not running at full speed

\-

More software than previous Lenovo PCs

 The Lenovo Legion Tower 7i isn't the flashiest prebuilt gaming PC, but with standardized parts, it's upgradeable for the future. We're fans of the board's four M.2 slots, which allow room for lots of storage (though one is taken up by the Wi-Fi card).

 There are four USB Type-A ports on the front, which is a nice amount for a gaming desktop, and it means you won't have to reach behind the system just to plug in some accessories or[external storage](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/external-storage) .  
  
 The combination of the Intel Core i9-13900KF and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 provided strong gaming scores across our benchmarks. Those should also make for a powerful workhorse, though our system wasn't running at advertised RAM speeds. While it includes DDR5-5600 RAM in the system, the sticks ran at 4,400 MHz, which may have an effect, particularly in productivity applications.

 But those looking for a gaming PC that doesn't stand out too much will have a powerful gaming PC in the Legion, especially if they're looking to make changes to the internals later.

The new model can fit large graphics cards, like the Nvidia RTX 4080 and RTX 4090, and also has a bit more room for upgradeability.  
  
 The One also follows another recent trend, offering wood paneling on the case. Corsair offers both dark and light wood, and in theory no two should look exactly the same.  
  
 Some of the cooling oculd use work, particularly on the CPU. There's a 120 mm radiator on the Core i9, but there's room for something bigger. That being said, performance didn't seem to suffer too much.  
  
 If you don't like bloatware, you'll like that the One comes largely clean. Corsair doesn't even use its own iCue software, instead opting for a minimalist app to control the RGB lighting. There's also a touch strip on the front to control the effects, but the software is more exact.

### How to Choose a Gaming PC

## How to Choose a Gaming PC

+ **Bigger isn't always better:** You don’t need a huge tower to get a system with high-end components. Only buy a big desktop tower if you like the look of it and want lots of room to install future upgrades.
+ **Get an SSD if at all possible:** This will make your computer far faster than loading off of a traditional HDD, and has no moving parts. Look for at least a 256GB SSD boot drive, ideally paired with a larger secondary SSD or a[best hard drive](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-hard-drives) for storage.
+ **You can't lose with Intel or AMD:** As long as you opt for a current-generation chip, both companies offer comparable overall performance. Intel’s CPUs tend to perform a bit better when running games at lower resolutions ([1080p](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/what-is-fhd-full-hd,5741.html) and below), while AMD’s Ryzen processors often handle tasks like video editing better, thanks to their extra cores and[threads](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-computing-thread-definition,5765.html) .
+ **Don’t buy more RAM than you need:** 8GB is OK in a pinch, but 16GB is ideal for most users. Serious game streamers and those doing high-end media creation working with large files will want more, but will have to pay a lot for options going as high as 64 or even 128GB.
+ **Don’t buy a multi-card gaming rig unless you have to:** If you’re a serious gamer, get a system with the best-performing single graphics card you can afford. Many games don’t perform significantly better with two or more cards in Crossfire or[SLI](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia0sli-scalable-link-interface-definition,5761.html) , and some perform worse, forcing you to disable an expensive piece of hardware to get the best experience possible. Because of these complications, you should only consider a multi-card desktop if you are after more performance than can be achieved with the best high-end consumer graphics card.
+ **The power supply is important:** Does the[PSU](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-psus,4229.html) offer enough juice to cover the hardware inside? (In most cases, the answer is yes, but there are some exceptions, particularly if you intend to[overclock a CPU](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/how-to-overclock-a-cpu) .) Additionally, note if the[PSU](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-psus,4229.html) will offer enough power for future upgrades to GPUs and other components. Case size and expansion options vary drastically between our picks.
+ **Ports matter:** Beyond the connections necessary to plug in your monitor(s), you’ll want plenty of USB ports for plugging in other peripherals and external storage. Front-facing ports are very handy for flash drives, card readers, and other frequently used devices. For added future-proofing, look for a system with[USB 3.1 Gen 2](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/usb-3-2-explained) and USB-C ports.
