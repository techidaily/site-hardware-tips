## Buying a New Laptop? Choose From the Latest Snapdragon Elite X Series with Integrated Microsoft Copilot Now Available

Several PC manufacturers recently[launched Qualcomm-powered laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) and many models are hitting store shelves and shipping out from today. These[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Arm-based[Snapdragon X chips](https://tools.techidaily.com) featuring a 45 TOPS NPU and have new AI-powered features,[like Paint’s Cocreator](https://tools.techidaily.com) , as well as access to the controversial Windows Recall feature that’s been relegated[to Windows Insiders](https://tools.techidaily.com) only.

 Although these new Copilot+ PCs are only getting a few new features to start with, other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more will use the built-in NPUs on these computers to run AI features locally. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Arm-based processors of these chips means we’re finally getting Windows laptops that can compete with the legendary battery life of Apple-silicon-powered MacBooks.

 So, if you’re in the market for a new Windows laptop and want to get in on the AI bandwagon, these are the Snapdragon X laptops launching today or in the next few weeks.

## Acer Swift 14 AI

 The Swift 14 AI is Acer’s bet on the Copilot+ PC, and it can be had with either a Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite chip. It also has a 75Wh battery, which the company claims will give the laptop up to 26 hours of battery life. You can also spec it with as much as 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.

 Of course,[Microsoft](https://tools.techidaily.com) will not lag behind the competition when it comes to Copilot+ PCs.

It also comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

 The more powerful Snapdragon X Elite chip-powered Surface Laptops start at $1,399.99 for the 13.8-inch version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Interestingly, the 15-inch model (which can only be had with a Snapdragon X Elite chip) starts at $1,299.99, but this one only has a 256GB SSD, which seems awfully small for today’s requirements. If you want to get this Copilot+ PC, the Surface Laptop is now available on[the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-7th-edition/8tq2hq5xxkj9) .

The Snapdragon X Elite Surface Pro starts at $1,499.99 but jumps to $1,699.99 for the larger storage version. You can also spec this chip with 32GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, but you’ll have to shell out $2,099.99 for this model. You can get it now from[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-pro-11th-edition/8n9t09p96cmj) if you want a new Windows 11 tablet.

 But if you need more space, you’ll have to go for the faster 3.8 GHz Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100\. This chip is only available on the 16-inch model but comes with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Whichever model you choose, the Galaxy Book4 Edge is now available on[the Samsung website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2Flink%3Fpublisher%255Fslug%3Dfuture%26exclusive%3D1%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-2146102897962536993%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fcomputing%252Fgalaxy-books%252Fgalaxy-book4-edge%252Fbuy%252Fgalaxy-book4-edge-16-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-1tb-sapphire-blue-np960xmb-kb1us%252F%26article%255Fname%3DMicrosoft%2520Copilot%252B%2520PCs%2520available%2520now%2520%25E2%2580%2594%2520here%2520are%2520all%2520the%2520Snapdragon%2520Elite%2520X%2520laptops%2520you%2520can%2520buy%2520today%2520%257C%2520Tom%27s%2520Hardware%26article%255Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.tomshardware.com%252Flaptops%252Fmicrosoft-copilot-pcs-available-now-here-are-all-the-snapdragon-elite-x-laptops-you-can-buy-today) .

 These laptops are the first tranche of the Copilot+ PCs that Microsoft and Qualcomm launched into the wild. They’re touted to have better performance and efficiency than x86 chips and will finally give Microsoft the horsepower it needs to compete against Apple M-Silicon laptops. However, if you’re considering getting one of these devices, we suggest holding off until you’ve seen our real-world reviews of these devices, so you know what you’re getting into when your new Copilot+ PC lands on your desk.
