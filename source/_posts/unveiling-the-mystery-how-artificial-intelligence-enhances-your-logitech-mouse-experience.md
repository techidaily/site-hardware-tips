## Unveiling the Mystery: How Artificial Intelligence Enhances Your Logitech Mouse Experience

Logitech is launching a computer mouse with a dedicated AI button, plus a new ChatGPT-prompting software for Windows and macOS. It puts AI at your fingertips, or in the palm of your hand, or something along those lines.

 The aptly-named [Logitech Signature AI Edition Mouse](http://logi.com/signature-ai-edition) features a dedicated "AI prompt button" that, when pressed, automatically opens Logitech's new [AI Prompt Builder](https://www.logitech.com/en-ch/software/logi-ai-prompt-builder.html) software. While I haven't had a chance to test it yet, the AI Prompt Builder looks a lot more polished than other chatbot-interaction apps. It's like a cross between Windows Copilot and the macOS Finder—press the AI Prompt Button on your mouse, and a compact ChatGPT interface appears at the center of your screen.

 Logitech's AI Prompt Builder provides a collection of preset "recipes" for quickly summarizing documents, rewriting paragraphs, or composing emails. However, you can also build custom AI recipes based on natural language instructions, such as "turn the following into a short story" or "rewrite this in the dialect of a mythical elf." And, to my surprise, the prompt builder doesn't require an OpenAI login or API credits. It just works.

 Stylistically, the Signature AI Edition Mouse looks like a premium version of the [Logitech's Marathon](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-M705-Wireless-Marathon-Mouse/dp/B087Z733CM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002738&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-launches-ai-mouse-and-prompt-builder%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)mouse. Both have a "sculpted" design, rubberized grip, forward and back thumb buttons, and a top button. But the AI Mouse is actually a revised version of the [Signature Plus M750](https://www.logitech.com/zh-cn/products/mice/m750-signature-plus-wireless-mouse.html), a China-exclusive mouse. Logitech simply changed the top button from a DPI switch to an AI shortcut.

 I'm surprised that Logitech went with this subdued design instead of an [MX Master](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-lock-apps-on-iphone-12-pro-and-ipad-securely-drfone-by-drfone-ios/)\-like build. But hey, it's no big deal. You can add the AI Prompt Builder shortcut to _any_ of Logitech's keyboards or mice, so long as they're compatible with [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-ch/software/logi-options-plus.html).

 Yes, you can disable the Signature AI Edition mouse's AI button (or program it to fulfill a different task) in Logi Options+. Some people might say, "just buy a different mouse," but I'll bet that Logitech has a slew of upcoming products with dedicated AI shortcut keys. Every new Windows computer has a dedicated [Copilot key](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-techniques-for-google-meet-aesthetic-enhancement/), so this seems like a pretty safe prediction.

 Anyway, the AI Prompt Builder software experience is now available on Windows and macOS through the [Logi Options+ app](https://www.logitech.com/en-ch/software/logi-options-plus.html). You can buy the Logitech [Signature AI Edition Mouse](http://logi.com/signature-ai-edition) later this month for $50.
