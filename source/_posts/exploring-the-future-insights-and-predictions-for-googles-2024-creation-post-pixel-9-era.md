 Google's August launch event is right upon us, and as we inch closer to the marked date, we're coming across more leaks and rumors about the devices the company will launch. One by one, let's discuss all the products the company could unveil at the "Made by Google" launch event on August 13th.

##  Google Moves Up Its Pixel Launch Event by Nearly Two Months

Google

 From the first Pixel phone in 2016 to [the Pixel 8](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-simple-guide-youtube-to-mp3-on-mac/) released in 2023, Google has launched its flagship smartphones in October. However, this year, the Alphabet-owned company moved up its "Made by Google" launch event to Tuesday, August 13th. While the company didn't provide a reason for it, nor did the Pixel fans ask for it, there's a chance that Google wants to present customers with a refreshed smartphone before [Apple does it in September with the iPhone 16](https://techidaily.com/what-you-need-to-know-to-improve-your-realme-narzo-n55-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/).

##  How To Watch The Made By Google August Launch Event?

 While Google will hold an in-person event at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, fans can watch the livestream on its official YouTube channel at 10 AM PT on August 13, 2024\. Enthusiasts can attend the "Made by Google Event Watch Party" at the [Google Visitor Experience Huddle](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/made-by-google-event-watch-party-mtv-08132024) in Mountain View. The company will also publish all the details about the new products, features, and services announced at the event on its official website.

##  New Google AI Features and Android 15

DALL-E 3

 With the [Android 15 beta reaching platform stability in June](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/best-live-stream-tools-xsplit-or-obs-in-2024/), we'll get to see the public version at the Made by Google event. With new features like widget previews, custom vibrations, partial screen recording, satellite connectivity support, [Private Space](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-by-drfone-android/), and anti-theft protection, Android 15 is going to be one of the most significant operating system upgrades, with a focus on AI. The new devices launched at the event will ship with it, and compatible smartphones like the Pixel 8 and [Pixel 7](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-split-mkv-videos-with-ease-top-10-free-software-options-for-2024/) series should get an OTA update after August 13.

 With Android 15, the company will also introduce or rather rebrand all its AI-based features as "Google AI." The umbrella term (like [Galaxy AI](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-instagram-story-tips/) or [Apple Intelligence](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-guide-for-apple-iphone-12-lock-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/)) will be used to refer to all Gemini-powered features. Although the current lineup of Pixel devices already supports a few advanced features, Google AI will bring a couple of new ones, including Add Me, Studio, and Pixel Screenshots.

 While Add Me adds users to a group photo, Studio could be an all-new feature that generates stickers and images. On the other hand, Pixel Screenshots indexes all the screenshots on users' devices and creates a searchable database of their information.

##  Pixel 9 Series With a New "XL" Variant

Google

 Like every year, there's going to be [the vanilla Pixel 9 and a Pixel 9 Pro](https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/new-master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-for-2024/). However, there's more to it than it sounds. The standard Pixel 9 will feature a 6.3-inch screen, a dual rear camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor, and more RAM than the outgoing Pixel 8\. According to leaked renders, the phone could come in four colors, including Rose (a bright pink shade), Hazel (light green), Porcelain (off-white), and Obsidian (dark gray).

 The regular Pixel 9 takes directly after the Pixel 8\. However, there's a new Pixel 9 Pro that retains the same size as the non-Pro model but adds a couple of features. Last but not least, there's the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which seems to be the successor to the Pixel 8 Pro (with a 6.8-inch screen). In comparison to the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will feature an [additional telephoto camera](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/recognizing-blockage-confirming-if-someone-ignored-imessage-communication-with-you/), more RAM, and possibly a larger battery. The Pro models could also ship in the same colors, except their hues could be slightly different from those on the regular Pixel 9.

 All the models will be powered by the Tensor G4 SoC, which, according to new reports, could be a minor improvement over [the Tensor G3 on the Pixel 8 series](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-copying-safely-on-tiktok-a-2023-guide-to-rights-checks/). What's exciting is that the processor could use a new modem, improving its overall efficiency. To summarize, Google could unveil three smartphones as part of the Pixel 9 series.

##  Pixel 9 Pro Fold Could Arrive With a New Camera Module

 Apart from the Pixel 9 series, Google will also unveil the much-anticipated successor to its one and only foldable. The [company has already confirmed the Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/quick-and-easy-steps-to-determine-which-windows-os-youre-running/). It is still a successor to the Pixel Fold from 2023, just that Google has improvised the name a bit. As seen in a teaser, the smartphone won't feature the horizontal camera visor on every Pixel phone launched in recent years. Instead, the phone has a square-ish camera module placed on the rear panel's top left corner. The foldable is also expected to be slightly thinner, taller, and lighter than the original Pixel Fold.

 We're also expecting a significant improvement in the phone's durability, and to achieve that, Google must work on the phone's frame, hinge, and flexible display. Like the rest of the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will also feature the Tensor G4 SoC. According to a report by [91Mobiles](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-google-pixel-9-series-promo-material-design-specs-ai-features/), the Pixel 9 Pro Fold could feature a 6.3-inch cover screen on the outside and an 8-inch foldable screen on the inside. Besides, the book-style foldable could share its specifications with the Pixel 9 Pro series. We're talking about similar performance, RAM/storage configurations, and cameras.

##  The Pixel Watch 3 Could Also Show Up

 Google could also reveal the Pixel Watch 3 on August 13\. According to an [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-changes-3458593/) report, the smartwatch could come in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Furthermore, Google will offer them both Wi-Fi and cellular variants. With the Pixel Watch 3, the company will address one of the most common complaints that users had with [the Pixel Watch 2](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ractical-techniques-for-rapid-deletion-of-comments/): thick bezels. Thinner bezels, a brighter screen, and support for ultra-wideband technology could be the main highlights of the purported wearable. Regarding colors, the Pixel Watch 3's 41mm variant could come in four combinations, while the 45mm variant could come in three colorways.

 Most recently, a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1eaz8zt/pixel%5Fbuds%5Fpro%5F2%5Fdesign%5Fleak/#lightbox) user spotted the Amazon listing of the Pixel Buds Pro 2, the successor to the [Pixel Buds Pro launched a few years ago](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-the-power-of-visual-appeal-in-your-youtube-advertising-for-2024/). As seen in the listing, the upcoming earbuds could feature similar dimensions to their predecessor. However, we might see new colors, a larger outer grill (on the top of the earbuds), and a speaker grill for locating the earbuds. Besides, the company could also improve the overall sound quality, noise cancelation, and battery life. Moreover, Google has a lot in store for us: the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Pixel Watch 3, and the Pixel Buds 2 Pro.
