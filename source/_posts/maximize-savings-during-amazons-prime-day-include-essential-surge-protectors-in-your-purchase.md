## Maximize Savings During Amazon's Prime Day: Include Essential Surge Protectors in Your Purchase

Amazon Prime Day is always a fun time to browse the deals and possibly pick up a [new TV](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/jaycut-for-beginners-learn-how-to-edit-videos-online-for-free/) or [smartphone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/). However, it can also be a great time to stock up on essentials—such as a new [surge protector](https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-rankings-top-budget-friendly-photo-editors-online-for-2024/).

 When did you last replace your surge protectors? While they may seem fine, [it's crucial to replace them](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-captivating-content-top-three-channel-growth-strategies/) every three or so years, as over time, they lose their ability to protect your devices from power surges. At best, you run the risk of frying your electronics, but it can also be downright dangerous:

 Plus, an old surge protector offers little protection for your electronic devices. These devices may become damaged due to the lack of surge protection—something that leads to more fire risks.

 And even if we ignore surge protection altogether, surge protectors tend to be crammed behind furniture and appliances. They're in the nastiest parts of your home, and they collect dust, crumbs, hair, and dead bugs—flammable stuff that slowly builds up over the years.

 So, when you're shopping Prime Day deals this week, add at least one new surge protector to your cart! Of course, surge protectors are also on sale, so we have a few good ones for you to choose from.

 Generally, when I'm looking for a new surge protector, I'm looking for one I can actually use all the plugs for. With standard surge protectors, it's hard to plug bigger plug bricks in, so a lot of ports can go unused. Anker has a [12-port surge protector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SG2Q23M?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) that has ports facing out (as well as direct USB-A and USB-C ports) that make it so you can plug everything you need to in. It's currently on sale for just $21.99!
