## Unbeatable Prime Day Deals: My Top-Pick Headphones Now at a Steal!

The Sony WH-1000XM5 is a fantastic pair of over-ear headphones, with support for Bluetooth, wired audio, ANC, and customizable settings. You can now pick up a pair for $100 off the original price.

 The [Sony XM5](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH/?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) is the company’s flagship over-ear headphones. They have a comfortable design with a soft leather covering, Bluetooth support with multi-point connectivity, and battery life of up to 30 hours. When you want to block out the world around you, you can turn on the active noise cancellation (ANC), or you can switch on ambient mode to let everything through.

 I bought the headphones a year and a half ago, and they’re definitely the best headphones I have used. The sound quality is great, and the ANC works well in noisy environments like airplanes. I especially like that they support wired audio with the included 3.5mm audio cable. That way, I can use them for games, audio editing, and other situations where I can’t deal with typical Bluetooth audio latency. Many other high-end headphones only support Bluetooth.

#####  Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones

$298 $400 Save $102 

Dive into unparalleled audio bliss with the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. Immerse yourself in premium sound quality, industry-leading noise cancellation, and long-lasting comfort.

[$298 at Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) [See at Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmGojsZ1fG3) 

 You can toggle the main audio modes (default, ANC, or ambient sound) with a physical button on the headphones, and there’s a smartphone app for changing other software settings and the audio EQ. The only setting I’ve changed is turning off the “Speak to Chat” feature, which tries to detect when you start talking and switches to ambient mode. It kept activating for me on phone calls, which meant I was hearing _all of my surroundings_ in addition to whoever I was talking to on the call.

 The headphones also come with a travel case, so you can more safely throw the headphones in a bag or backpack. Annoyingly, you can’t fold up the headphones to be more compact.

 You can [buy the Sony XM5 headphones on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH/?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) for $298, or [get them at Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmGojsZ1fG3) for $300\. The original price was $400, so this is technically a discount of $100, but more recently the price has hovered around $320-$350\. This sale also isn’t the lowest recorded price, since it did briefly drop to $250 during the 2023 holiday season. Still, $300 for these headphones is a pretty good deal.
