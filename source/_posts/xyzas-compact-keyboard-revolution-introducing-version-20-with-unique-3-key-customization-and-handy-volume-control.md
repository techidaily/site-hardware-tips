## ASUS ROG AZOTH Extreme: Ultimate Gamer's Choice - OLED Touch Screen, Robust Aluminum Body with Carbon Fiber at $499

75% Gaming keyboards are very popular among gamers and everyday users as they often provide a quality mechanical switch experience with more reasonable pricing. However, the lower pricing aspect goes out the window with the[ROG Azoth Extreme](https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=332082&a=2384895&epi=tomshardware-us-1432520134697393829&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpress.asus.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fazoth-extreme-75-percent-keyboard%2F) , which packs an abundance of features while commanding a hefty price of $499.99\.

 To provide comfort during use while providing that 'thock' acoustics many users prefer, the Azoth Extreme has multiple foam layers and a carbon fiber plate, similar in build what companies like[Meletrix](https://tools.techidaily.com) provide, with an exception being that the Azoth Extreme is a complete build, ready to work out of the box. Asus bundles a silicone wristrest to provide additional comfort. It also includes wired and wireless connectivity to both Windows and macOS through its USB connectivity, Bluetooth 5.3, and radio frequency for wireless. To enable higher polling rates for the keyboard, Asus bundles a dongle that allows polling up to 8,000 Hz.

[During Computex 2024](https://tools.techidaily.com) , Asus reps mentioned the option to choose between tactile and linear feedback NX switches, though the website does not show this option.

 The NX switches use stems for Cherry MX compatible keycaps and you can hot-swap its mechanical switches. For the price, however, you probably won't want to hot-swap either the switches or change the keycaps — which are hopefully an improvement over the previously released ROG Azoth. Asus' proprietary software didn't provide a good experience when we reviewed that keyboard.
