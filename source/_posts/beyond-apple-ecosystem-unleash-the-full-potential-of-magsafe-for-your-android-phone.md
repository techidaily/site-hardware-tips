 Android phones are great, but there are some [clear advantages to using an iPhone](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-optimal-recording-for-virtual-meetings-top-5-equipment-lists/). Like the wealth of accessories that are available for iPhones. When it comes to MagSafe accessories, you don't have to feel left out.

 "[MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/)" was introduced with the iPhone 12 series in 2020\. Not to be confused with the [old MagSafe](https://www.reviewgeek.com/21663/add-magsafe-charging-to-your-macbook-pro-with-these-cables-and-adapters/), it's essentially just a magnetic ring built-in to the back iPhone. That ring allows you to attach all sorts of things to the back of the phone with perfect alignment. Pretty neat.

 At the time of writing, there have been three series of iPhones with MagSafe. There are now thousands of MagSafe [chargers](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-battle-royale-games/), battery packs, wallets, and mounts on the market. Wouldn't it be cool if your Android phone could use some of them? Well, it can, and it's shockingly easy to do.

##  One Ring to Stick Them All

![MagSafe Ring on Pixel 5.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/magsafe-ring-on-pixel.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 As mentioned, MagSafe works with a magnetic ring in the back of the iPhone. So all we really need to use MagSafe accessories with an Android phone is a stand-in for that ring. Thankfully, you can easily get adhesive-backed metal MagSafe rings on Amazon for cheap.

 For only $10, you can grab a [six-pack of adhesive-backed MagSafe rings](https://www.amazon.com/Wannap-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Sticker/dp/B075YB8C7F?tag=htg-v2-41ll985-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203993&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840644%2Fmagsafe-isnt-just-for-iphones-its-great-on-android-too%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The pack includes three silver rings and three black rings. You can stick the ring on the back of your phone, case, or underneath your case.

 Technically, the iPhone has more than just a magnetic ring. There's also a small "alignment magnet" under the ring. This is supposed to help keep MagSafe accessories in place. If you'd like to have that as well, there's a [four-pack of adhesive-backed rings](https://www.amazon.com/Adhesive-Accessories-Python-Trend-One/dp/B09WRSNB3L?tag=htg-v2-41ll985-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203993&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840644%2Fmagsafe-isnt-just-for-iphones-its-great-on-android-too%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) that includes an alignment tab.

##  Slap on Some Accessories
