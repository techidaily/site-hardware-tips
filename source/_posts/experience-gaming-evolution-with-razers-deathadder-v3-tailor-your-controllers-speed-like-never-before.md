## Experience Gaming Evolution with Razer's DeathAdder V3 – Tailor Your Controller’s Speed Like Never Before!

Razer's newest competitive gaming mouse, the DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, is a paradox. It's a slight downgrade from other mice in Razer's catalog, but it comes with a unique Dynamic Sensitivity setting that may convince gamers to stop worrying about specs.

 Priced at $100, the [DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-hyperspeed%2FRZ01-05140100-R3U1) is a "third pillar" in the DeathAdder V3 family. It's a mid-range alternative to the wired [DeathAdder V3](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3) and the premium [V3 Pro](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-pro), which cost $70 and $150, respectively. The V3 HyperSpeed isn't just the halfway point between a cheap and expensive mouse, though. It's a unique entry in the DeathAdder series, and I suspect that some gamers will prefer it over the V3 Pro.

 The headlining feature here (at least from a hardware perspective) is a lightweight, smaller-than-usual design. Razer shrunk the V3 HyperSpeed down to length of 4.81 inches and a width of 2.55 inches, meaning that it's about 5% smaller than the other entries in this series. And at just 55 grams, the V3 HyperSpeed is noticeably lighter than either of its siblings.

 Naturally, the V3 HyperSpeed comes with a USB dongle for 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity (and supports wired connectivity over USB). But it also features an all-new Focus X 26K optical sensor, which is technically a downgrade from the 30K sensor in the standard V3 and the V3 Pro. This sensor has a slightly reduced DPI (26000), acceleration (40G), and IPS (500), though it's still a perfect option for competitive gaming, and it's probably responsible for the V3 HyperSpeed's mid-range price.

 The Focus X 26K optical sensor comes with a special trick. It supports [Dynamic Sensitivity and Rotational Tool](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-focus-x-sensor) customization, both of which can be programmed in the Razer Synapse interface. Dynamic Sensitivity allows you to make quick 180-degree camera movements when playing at a low DPI (some people prefer a slower cursor speed when playing first-person shooters). You can adjust Dynamic Sensitivity on a curve, just as you would when using a premium console controller like the DualSense Edge or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller.

 The Rotation Tool lets you adjust the angle of the mouse sensor to compensate for an angled swipe or setup. Basically, it's for people who can't make perfect horizontal swipes across their screen due to mouse position or muscle memory.

 Other specs remain unchanged from the DeathAdder V3 Pro. Razer is sticking with its Optical Gen-3 switches and customizable side buttons. The V3 HyperSpeed has a polling rate of 1000 Hz when using the standard 2.4 GHz wireless dongle, but it can operate at 8000 Hz if you own a [Hyperpolling Wireless Dongle](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice-accessories%2Frazer-hyperpolling-wireless-dongle) (sold separately). The 100-hour battery life, which dips down to 20 hours when an 8000Hz polling rate is enabled, is also comparable to that of the V3 Pro.

 You can purchase the DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed today at the [Razer web store](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003746&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-hyperspeed%2FRZ01-05140100-R3U1). It costs $100, which is a fairly reasonable price for a competitive gaming mouse with wireless connectivity.
