## Elite Performance Meets Elegance: Introducing Corsair's High-Performance Rig in Stunning Wood Finish

Corsair is best known for its gaming accessories and pre-built computers, and now the company is trying something a bit different. The Corsair One i500 is a new gaming PC that mixes high-end hardware with a unique design.

 The Corsair One i500 is a new desktop PC tower intended for “content creators, AI-savvy professionals, and gamers.” It has an aluminum case with FSC-certified real wood panels, which certainly stands out from the crowed of tempered glass PC cases. It’s also “30% smaller than a full-sized desktop PC.”

 The base model contains a 14th-generation Intel Core i9-14900K processor, an NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super graphics card, a 2TB M.2 SSD, and 32GB of DDR5 memory. There’s also an upgraded model that swaps out the 4080 Super for a 4090 GPU, and it doubles the RAM to 64GB. Both versions are liquid-cooled, and both are available in either a light or dark wood color. You also get a lot of ports and connectivity options, including support for up to six monitors and USB ports on both the front and back.

 Corsair said in a press release, “The Corsair One i500 PC is 30% smaller than a full-sized desktop PC but doesn’t compromise on power. Modern liquid cooling delivers top-tier thermal efficiency, minimizing CPU and GPU temperatures while achieving faster performance, all while being noticeably quieter than traditional cooling. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 SUPER graphics cards power a quantum leap in framerates and AI-powered graphics, while Intel 14th Gen CPU architecture makes sure you game and multitask without compromise.”

 Corsair also made a point to discuss the computer’s upgradability, perhaps in comparison to [Apple’s Mac Studio and Mac Pro workstations](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), which can’t be significantly modified or upgraded after purchase. The Corsair One i500 uses standard PCIe, RAM, and SSD slots, so you can replace the graphics card when it gets too old or has a hardware failure. However, the smaller case size means not all GPUs will fit, and it seems like replacing the motherboard is not supported.

 The [Corsair One base model costs $3,600](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/gaming-computers/cs-9020038-na/corsair-one-i500-pc-wood-dark-liquid-cooled-intel-core-i9-14900k-and-nvidia-rtx-4080-super-2tb-m-2-ssd-32gb-ddr5-win11-home-cs-9020038-na), and the [upgraded model is $4,700](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/gaming-computers/cs-9020036-na/corsair-one-i500-pc-wood-dark-liquid-cooled-intel-core-i9-14900k-and-nvidia-rtx-4090-2tb-m-2-ssd-64gb-ddr5-win11-pro-cs-9020036-na). You can order them starting today from the company’s online store.
