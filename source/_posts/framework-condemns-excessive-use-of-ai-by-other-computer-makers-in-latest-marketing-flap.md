## Revolutionize Your Tech Setup: New Framework's Latest Innovation with DeepComputing's StarFive SoC Board Features Advanced RISC-V Technology for Laptops

Framework has[announced](https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1803072040569901452) that it’s partnering with DeepComputing to create a mainboard powered by[a RISC-V processor](https://tools.techidaily.com) . This mainboard will be a drop in replacement for the modular Framework Laptop 13, giving more people easy access to the RISC-V CPU architecture. You can also purchase the RISC-V mainboard separately from the laptop, perhaps instead buying[the Cooler Master Mainboard Case](https://www.coolermaster.com/en-global/products/framework/) to use it as a Mini-PC.

 DeepComputing is the company behind[the first RISC-V laptop](https://tools.techidaily.com) and has[recently been released in its second generation](https://tools.techidaily.com) . But despite all its work on the DC-ROMA RISC-V Laptop II, the company was also busy in the background, building the Framework RISC-V Mainboard. In fact, the company already has a working prototype, and it will show it off at the RISC-V Summit Europe next week.

 Framework’s philosophy of ‘an open system ecosystem is more powerful than the sum of its parts’ is a perfect fit with RISC-V’s open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Contemporary Framework laptops are available with either an Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen 7040 processor — proprietary x86 chips owned by Intel and AMD. Aside from these two chips, which own most of the PC market, we also have the Apple M-silicon and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, with the latter[going on-sale yesterday as Microsoft Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) . However, these chips are based on the ARM ISA, which is owned and licensed by Arm Holdings.

 On the other hand, because RISC-V is an open and royalty-free standard, anyone can use and build on it without needing to ask for permission from RISC-V International, the Swiss-based non-profit association that maintains the ISA, or pay licensing fees.

 This means building on RISC-V could be cheaper than competing proprietary architectures, that’s why many companies and startups are interested in iterating on it. The recent AI boom is even forecasted to[grow this standard’s industry adoption by 50% annually](https://tools.techidaily.com) until 2030\. Some examples of this include SiFive, which partnered with a Chinese manufacturer to[build a RISC-V development board](https://tools.techidaily.com) , and[Google](https://tools.techidaily.com) , which[uses RISC-V cores](https://tools.techidaily.com) for its AI silicon. X-Silicon Inc. has even[created a RISC-V chip that runs CPU, GPU, and NPU workloads](https://tools.techidaily.com) simultaneously.

 Aside from cost considerations, RISC-V’s open nature means the U.S. cannot restrict other companies and countries from accessing it. The RISC-V Foundation, which was based in the California, even moved to Switzerland in 2019 because of Washington’s restrictive trade regulations and renamed itself to RISC-V International. This move to a historically neutral country meant laws cannot be used to limit anyone’s access to the ISA.

 Nevertheless,[American lawmakers are still investigating China’s access to this technology](https://tools.techidaily.com) , especially as Washington is working hard to[restrict Beijing’s access](https://tools.techidaily.com) to advanced tech. However, since it remains open, many[Chinese startups](https://tools.techidaily.com) [and companies](https://tools.techidaily.com) are taking advantage of this ISA, allowing them to produce chips that aren’t restricted by American sanction.

 Framework sees this trend, so by working with DeepComputing to introduce a RISC-V mainboard, it would make it easier for more people to get interested in and experiment with the standard. Although the company says that this RISC-V laptop will not have the performance of its AMD and Intel processors, it will be “a great way to start playing with RISC-V though (sic) inside of a thin, light, refined laptop.”
