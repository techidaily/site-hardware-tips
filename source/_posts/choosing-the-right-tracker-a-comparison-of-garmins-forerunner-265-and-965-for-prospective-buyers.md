## Upcoming Changes: Apple Set to Enhance Budget-Friendly Watch SE - Exciting Updates Await![ZDNet]

Apple's biggest event of the year is coming up: its annual [September keynote](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-apples-iphone-16-its-glowtime-event-and-how-to-watch-the-livestream/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https:/www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-apples-iphone-16-its-glowtime-event-and-how-to-watch-the-livestream/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22September%20keynote%22}) \-- this year, dubbed as "It's Glowtime." The tech giant usually debuts a new iPhone series as well as new Apple Watch models, and this year, we might see an upgrade to the lower-end Apple Watch SE model. 

**Also:** **[What to expect from Apple's iPhone 16 'It's Glowtime' event, and how to watch the livestream](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-to-expect-from-apples-iphone-16-its-glowtime-event-and-how-to-watch-the-livestream/)**

The last time Apple upgraded the [Apple Watch SE](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-se-2nd-generation-gps-40mm-starlight-aluminum-case-with-starlight-sport-band-s-m-starlight%2F6340296.p%3FskuId%3D6340296&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) was in 2022, so the 2024 model (3rd generation) is due for some changes and improvements. According to [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches), these include a plastic case, which would swap out the 2nd gen's aluminum case, potentially as a cost-saving move to make the SE drop in price even lower than its current price of $250\. 

The possible switch to plastic makes sense since the Apple Watch SE is targeted towards kids as a "first smartwatch" option. The current SE model has smaller screen sizes than the Series 9 (40mm or 44mm), less storage capacity of 32GB, and an S8 chip instead of the S9 chip. 

New upgrades to the 3rd gen model could integrate more health and tracking features that the [Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Tracker/dp/B0CHX93LYL?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20) has, such as tracking blood oxygen, ECG heart checks, and checking your temperature. It could also bump up the processor to the S9 chip (assuming it follows the same trend as the previous SE models in being behind by one processor).

Regarding other Apple Watches to look out for during the event, the Series 10 (or Series X, some speculate) watches are rumored to get an updated look through larger screen sizes and a thinner design. More accurate sensors and the addition of sleep apnea detection to sleep tracking are also possible upgrades.
