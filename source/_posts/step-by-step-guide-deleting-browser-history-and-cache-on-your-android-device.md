 Websites can store data—like your login state, preferences, and even tracking information—in cookies, which are pieces of information your web browser remembers. You can clear browser cookies whenever you want: Here's how to do it on Android.

##  What Are Browser Cookies and Site Data?

 When you visit a website, it will remember certain information, which it stores in [your browser's cookies](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/best-10-mock-location-apps-worth-trying-on-realme-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and site data. This is stuff like passwords and user settings that are saved so it's easy to use the site the next time you visit it. However, this data can add up and take up space over time, and it can also cause issues with how the website behaves. Once in a while, you may need to clear out the information to free up space or make the browser run better.
