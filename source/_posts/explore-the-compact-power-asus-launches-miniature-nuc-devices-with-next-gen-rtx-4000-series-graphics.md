## Explore the Compact Power: ASUS Launches Miniature NUC Devices with Next-Gen RTX 4000 Series Graphics

Even though PC gaming is great, consoles remain popular for their ease of use and (usually) more compact size, among other factors. If you've ever wanted a gaming PC that's about that size, or even smaller, ASUS might just have the tiny PC for you.

 ASUS has launched [two new compact gaming PCs](https://tidd.ly/3Y4eALy), the ROG NUC 970 and NUC 760\. These [tiny PCs](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-sony-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/) come fully equipped with Intel's latest Meteor Lake CPUs and Nvidia's RTX 40-series mobile graphics, making them ready for AAA gaming and content creation. Gaming is the clear focus here, as these belong to ASUS' ROG sub-brand, but they also make for insanely powerful PCs.

 The top-tier NUC 970 boasts the flagship 16-core Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4070 GPU. The NUC 760 offers a still-powerful 16-core Meteor Lake CPU with a slightly lower clock speed, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an RTX 4060 GPU. Both of these models should be able to offer excellent performance for 1080p gaming.

 Both models feature an extensive array of ports, including USB 3.2 Gen2, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet, and an SD card reader. They also come with Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth, and Realtek audio built-in.

 In a departure from the traditional bare-bones NUC kits, ASUS is offering these PCs pre-built with Windows 11 Home preinstalled. While currently listed as out of stock, the ROG NUC 970 and NUC 760 look pretty good for those who are looking for a gaming PC that doesn't take up too much space. The NUC 970 configuration is priced at $2,199, while the NUC 960 can be yours starting at $1,699\. Once it goes back in stock, you'll be able to grab it from [ASUS' online store](https://tidd.ly/3Y4eALy).
