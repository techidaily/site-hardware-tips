## Are Smart Rings Allowed in Airports: Understanding Security Check Regulations?

The TSA has not defined any rules or best practices for small wearable devices. So, the information in this article is based on the anecdotal experience of smart ring and smartwatch owners. We've repeatedly requested information from the TSA and will update this article if we receive a response.

 Rings and other small jewelry are rarely a problem at airport security. In fact, the TSA prefers that you keep these items on your person to avoid any losses at security checkpoints. But smart rings contain biometric sensors, batteries, and other unusual components—if you own an Oura or Galaxy Ring, do you need to remove it before being screened?

 Smart rings, like smartwatches, can be worn through TSA security checkpoints when flying domestically. Your smart ring won't cause any problems when receiving a full-body scan, and it's too small to set off a properly calibrated metal detector. If the metal detector happens to pick up your smart ring, TSA may simply run a scanning wand over your hand.

 That said, the TSA _does not_ have defined rules for smart rings or smartwatches. And regardless of whatever rules or norms are in place, _TSA officers always have the final say in the screening process_. On rare occasions, TSA personnel may ask fliers to remove their smartwatches and smart rings—it's happened before, but it's an uncommon occurrence.

 If you are asked to remove your smart ring, you should avoid placing it at the bottom of a scanning bin, as it may tip out or get stolen. Place the ring in your carry-on bag (within a hard container, such as a charging case) or ask TSA to keep it in a small dish so that it doesn't leave your line of sight while you're being scanned.

 Note that international flights may follow stricter security practices than domestic flights. Customs officers in some countries can be overzealous about jewelry, too.

 In any case, try to keep jewelry and other valuable items in your personal posession while traveling. Placing jewelry in checked bags increases the risk of personal loss and is [highly discouraged](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/jewelry) by the TSA. This is doubly important when traveling internationally, as some countries are infamous for their corrupt customs or security officers.
