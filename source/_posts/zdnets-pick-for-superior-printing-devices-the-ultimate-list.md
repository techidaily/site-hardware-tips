## ZDNet's Pick for Superior Printing Devices - The Ultimate List

Thanks to hybrid working schedules, it's likely that you have a home office set-up of some sort -- and a part of that set-up should include a printer. Students also need a printer to print out those essays, notes, and other assignments. If you don't have one or are looking to upgrade, you've come to the right place. 

**Also:** [**The best cheap printers (starting at $105)**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/best-cheap-printer/)

When it comes to printers you can utilize in your home, it's best to stick to inkjet, photo, or laser printers. Any of these three printer types are great for work, school, crafts, or general household operations like printing out recipes or [to-do lists](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-google-keep-and-how-to-use-it-as-your-virtual-to-do-list-maker/). 

"Determine the purpose of the printer and the volume of printing you expect to do."

 Jordi Hilpert, 10printers

## What is the best printer right now?

Our top pick for most people is the [Epson Ecotank ET-3850 printer](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fepson-ecotank-et-3850-all-in-one-supertank-inkjet-printer-white%2F6470010.p%3FskuId%3D6470010&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for its long-lasting ink bottles, smartphone and tablet printing, and waste efficiency, but I also included photo printers and laser printers to give you plenty of options for your printing needs.

More Details 

**Epson EcoTank ET-3850 features** **: Functions:** Scan, copy, and print two-sided | **PPM rate:** 8.5 ppm (color), 15.5 ppm (monochrome) | **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 

The Ecotank printer comes with ink tanks that can be refilled from bottled ink. Epson estimates that one set of ink bottles provides the equivalent of about 90 cartridges. Customers who have bought this printer say that if you print often, especially in color, this cartridge-free approach can save you a lot of money in the long run.

The Ecotank's print speed is 15.5 pages per minute for black and white, and 8.5 pages per minute for color. Additionally, this unit includes Wi-Fi direct so you can print without connecting to a router. A big advantage is that it includes enough ink to print 7,500 pages in black and 6,000 in color, which may justify the printer's upfront cost. In addition, it has an auto-document feeder, two-sided printing, and activation compatibility for even more productivity.

## Which printer is right for you?

While each of these printers is a great pick for your home office, it ultimately depends if you want an inkjet, photo, or laser printer. Plus, is speed or printer size more important to you? Consider how you'll use the printer and how much you're willing to spend, too.

## How did we choose these printers?

We chose these printers through a combination of extensive research and testing the products ourselves. We also spoke to several professionals who use and recommend our top picks. In addition, we paid attention to customer reviews and ratings, pricing, renowned brands, and different features each printer has. It also came down to the following factors: 

**Printer type:** You may need a different printer based on your home or office needs, so we included three types of printers: inkjet, photo, and laser. These are the main types of printers on the market today. 

**PPM:** Pages per minute or PPM is an important factor to determine a printer's overall speed. The numbers will vary based on color or black-and-white ink, as well as the printer type. For example, laser printers are able to print much faster than inkjet ones.

**Price:** Printers vary in price range from affordable to expensive, so we considered different price points for different needs. The most expensive printer on this list is $849, but I also included one for $80\. 

## What is an inkjet printer?

An inkjet printer is simply a printer that uses ink to print documents. However, these devices have come a long way from the frustrating days when you ran out of ink. Now, inkjet printers have zero-waste cartridges, connection to Wi-Fi and cloud services, and the ability to print directly from your smartphone. 

## What is a photo printer?

[Photo printers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-photo-printer/) offer a wide variety of formats along with some unexpected gimmicks. Interestingly, two of our top photo printers are from the old school film brands: Fujifilm and Kodak. 

I've included smaller photo printers that are for more casual and fun printing, as well as one high-quality option for those photos that you want to frame and remember. 

## What is a laser printer?

The main difference between inkjet printers and laser printers is that inkjet printers use ink to print while laser printers use, you guessed it, lasers. Laser printers are best for handling heavy volumes of text-based documents since they print at faster speeds, and they are also more economical and eco-friendly, since you won't have to worry about buying cartridges and the proper ways to dispose of them.

## What image format is best for photo printing?

Most images are in JPEG format, and this is the best-compressed image format for photo printing, especially when printing photographs and artwork. TIFF and PDF formats are also excellent for photo printing. 

## How many years is a printer good for?

The average lifespan of a printer is three to five years, but that also depends on the printer type. For example, laser printers will usually last longer than inkjet printers. 

If you do not use your printer often, be sure to turn it on once every two weeks to prevent the nozzles from clogging. If you leave a printer off and unused for too long, it is more likely to malfunction. 

## Are there alternative printers worth considering?

There are plenty more printers on the market aside from the ones listed above. Here are a few other options to look into for your home office from trusted brands.
