##  Why Is Your Android Phone Not Charging?

 As with most things tech, charging problems can lie with hardware or software. However, in Android phones it's usually caused by faulty chargers or power outlets. Parts of the charger might have become damaged, preventing the phone from charging. Hardware problems in parts like the charging port could also be the cause of the charging issue.

##  How To Get Your Android Phone To Charge

 Now that you know why your Android phone isn't charging, try these fixes to get your Android phone charging again. Let's begin!

###  Reboot Your Phone

 The first thing to do when faced with any Android issue or bug is to reboot your phone. Rebooting clears the memory and closes background apps, giving your phone a fresh start.

 To reboot your phone, press the power button at the side of your phone until you see the Android power menu. Tap on the "Restart" button.

 Wait for your device to power off and then on. Plug in the phone and it should begin charging.

###  Check Your Power Adapter and Cable

 Take a look at your adapter and cable. Is the adapter damaged, burnt, or broken? Is your cable frayed or cut at the edges? These damages might cause them to stop charging your phone properly. Try charging your phone with a different charger. If it starts charging, your adapter or cable is the problem. Test the different parts to see which is bad and then replace them.

###  Check The Power Outlet

 If you still get no response with a different charger, try a different power outlet. There might be issues with the outlet your phone is plugged into. If you're connected to a power bank or a USB port on a computer and your phone isn't charging, move to a power outlet. Sometimes, power banks and computer USB ports charge phones really slowly, which might come off as not charging.

###  Remove Your Phone Case

 Thick phone cases might hinder the charger from being plugged in completely into the charging port. You can check by simply charging the phone with the case off. If the phone charges, then you know the case is the problem. A case can also cause issues with wireless charging. If the case is too thick it could slow down charging, and certain materials can block charging altogether.

###  Check Your Charging Port

 Check your charging port for damage, stuck objects, and dust. If dust is present, blow a can of compressed air into the port to remove it. If stuck objects are present, carefully use a toothpick to dislodge them if you can.

 If the charging port is damaged or you can not remove the object, take your phone to a repair center. They can fix it.

###  Put Your Phone in Safe Mode

 Putting your phone in safe mode starts the Android phone without running any third-party apps. Doing this will help you troubleshoot and check if the charging problem is from a third-party app that you installed.

 To boot your phone in safe mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the quick settings. Press and hold the power button to get the option for Safe Mode. Check out our guide to get more in-depth steps on [how to put your phone in safe mode](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-crafting-visual-magic-the-essentials-of-snapchat-photo-editing/).

 When your phone is in safe mode, all third-party apps will be greyed out and inaccessible. Now, plug in your phone and check if it charges. If it does, then third-party apps are responsible for the bug. Leave safe mode and uninstall all newly installed apps.

 To uninstall an app, just hold down the app on the home screen and then click on "Uninstall." You can also [uninstall multiple apps at once using Google Play Store](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-simplest-way-win-clownfish-vocal-alteration-tool/).

###  Confirm That It's Not A Screen Problem

 Charging your phone when its battery is dead should make the screen light up with a battery icon. If your screen doesn't come on when you plug it in, you should confirm that the problem doesn't come from a damaged screen before troubleshooting the battery or charging port.

 Check your screen to make sure it isn't cracked or filled with ink. If it is fine, try calling your phone. You can do that from another phone or with [Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find/). If your phone rings, your phone isn't dead. It's charging, but the screen is bad. You should take your phone to a repair center to get your screen fixed.

###  Allow Your Phone To Dry If It's Wet

 Some phones can tell if the device is wet or has moisture trapped in it. To prevent issues, sometimes the phone stops charging until it gets dry. Leave your phone out to sit and dry for a while. When it dries completely, you can begin charging it. But please, [don't put your phone in a bowl of rice](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/easily-unlock-your-oppo-k11-5g-device-sim-by-drfone-android/).

###  Switch Off Your Phone And Leave It To Charge

 If everything fails, switch your phone off and leave it to charge. Sometimes, charging might be slow and a watched pot never boils.

 Switching it off ensures that the phone gets to charge without any process or apps taking up the power. Check your phone after an hour, and you should notice a change in your battery percentage if everything is working as it should.

###  Take The Phone To A Repair Center

 If your phone still doesn't charge, it is most likely a hardware issue. Take your Android phone to an authorized repair center to get it checked and fixed. Be careful, however, that the repair doesn't void your phone's warranty. Batteries are one of the most volatile parts of a phone. While most components don't "age" much over time, batteries and charging ports take a lot of abuse
