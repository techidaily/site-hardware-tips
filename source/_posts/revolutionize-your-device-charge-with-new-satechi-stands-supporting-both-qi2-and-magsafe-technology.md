## Revolutionize Your Device Charge with New Satechi Stands Supporting Both Qi2 and MagSafe Technology

###  UPDATE: 2024/04/25 16:31 EST BY CORBIN DAVENPORT

**_Chargers Now Available_** 

 You can now buy the [3-in-1 Charging Stand](https://satechi.net/products/3-in-1-magnetic-wireless-charging-stand) and [2-in-1 Charging Stand](https://satechi.net/products/aluminum-2-in-1-magnetic-wireless-charging-stand) from Satechi's online store. The stands should appear at other retailers soon, too.

 Satechi is one of the best accessory manufacterors around, and it just unveiled two new latest devices at CES 2024: the 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand. We've seen plenty of similar chargers for iPhones, but this is one of the first accessories certified for all Qi2 devices, including future Android phones.

 The new charging stands are built around the new [Qi2 charging standard](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-becoming-a-bull-or-bear-best-stock-vids-on-youtube-for-2024/), based on Apple's MagSafe technology. They can deliver 15W of power to an iPhone, 5W of power to AirPods, and 5W of power to an Apple Watch, using magnets to keep the devices in place. They also support [StandBy mode in iOS 17](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), which lets you view important information while your phone is charging in landscape orientation. Unlike some other recent chargers, like the [Nomad Stand One](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-professionals-choice-best-top-10-4k-monitors/), the Satechi 3-in-1 charger can fit a landscape phone and an Apple Watch at the same time.

 The 3-in-1 (pictured below) and 2-in-1 (pictured above) Qi2 Wireless Charging Stands have a foldable design, making them easy to pack and carry. The 3-in-1 Charging Stand also comes with a 45W power adapter that can be used separately to charge other USB-C devices, as well as two travel adapters for international use. Both charging stands have a premium-grade aluminum enclosure, a vegan-leather base, a soft silicone charging puck, and sturdy hinges that can support the entire iPhone lineup from iPhone 15 to iPhone 12.

 These are some of the first chargers built for the Qi2 charging standard, which means they will work with Android phones with Qi2 charging, in addition to MagSafe-compatible iPhone models. We're still waiting on Android devices with Qi2, thoughâ€”it's unclear if the upcoming Galaxy S24 series will support it.

 The 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be available in the second quarter of 2024 on [Satechi's online store](https://satechi.net/Qi2) for $129.99 and $79.99, respectively. Those prices aren't too high compared to the competition, but if the folding design and Apple Watch charging aren't important to you, [Anker's $40 PowerWave 2-in-1 stand](https://amazon.com/dp/B094FMWPPM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001459&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsatechi-qi2-charging-stands-ces-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) might be a compelling alternative.
