##  Take Scrolling Screenshots

 What if you want to take a screenshot of more than what appears on the screen? [A "scrolling" screenshot](https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/downloading-the-linksys-ae1200-driver-made-easy-and-quick-for-all-users/) can capture long screenshots, such as a full webpage.

 The process for doing this is straightforward. You'll take a screenshot with one of the regular methods, then select the scrolling screenshot icon on the thumbnail preview. From there, you'll either be able to scroll more to capture more, or be presented with a crop-able version of the full page.

##  Take a Screenshot With Your Voice

 You don't have to touch the screen or press any buttons to take a screenshot if you don't want to. Google Assistant has the ability to take screenshots on Android devices. All you need to do is say the command:

* "Hey Google, take a screenshot."

 The screenshot will be captured, and you'll immediately see the options to share, edit, or delete the screenshot.

##  Draw on Top of Screenshots

 One reason why you might be taking a screenshot is to highlight something on the screen. Being able to draw on the screenshot makes it a lot easier to do that. Thankfully, it's very easy to [edit screenshots on Android devices](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-s-best-time-lapse-video-editing-tools-a-comprehensive-review/).

 After you take a screenshot, you'll see a few options in the thumbnail preview that appears in the bottom corner. Look for a pencil icon to take you to some editing tools. Here, you'll see pens, markers, and highlighters for drawing.
