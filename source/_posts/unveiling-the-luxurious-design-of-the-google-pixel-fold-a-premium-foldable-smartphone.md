## Unveiling the Luxurious Design of the Google Pixel Fold: A Premium Foldable Smartphone

Google [revealed the Pixel Fold](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-precision-and-performance-in-every-shade-the-eizo-cg318-4k-monitor/) last week, following months of leaks and rumors, but there still weren't many details about the phone. Today at Google I/O, the company revealed more about its first folding phone.

 The Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone, in the same form factor as the Samsung [Galaxy Z Fold](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unlock-reddit-potentials-stepwise-procedures-for-sharing/). There's a small screen on the exterior, with a larger 7.6-inch display visible when the phone is fully opened. Google says it's the thinnest folding phone on the market, and it has the same Tensor G2 chipset as the Pixel 7 and new [Pixel 7a](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-parallel-playback-prowess-for-2024/).

 Google is also working on software features in its apps for the unique form factor, some of which was initially built for foldables from Samsung and other companies. There's a "table-top mode" in YouTube, with the video on one side of the fold and other information on the other side of the screen. Google also showed off a live translation mode in Google Translate, where each screen is used for the other person's conversations.

 You can now [pre-order the Pixel Fold](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Ffold) on the Google Store for $1799 and will start to ship next month. Pre-orders also include a Pixel Watch.
