## Top Back-to-School Technology Discounts of 2024 - Secure Your Student's Must-Have Gadgets Now

Enjoy what's left of the summer as you prepare to head back to school or maybe to your first year of college. Have you made a list of all the tech you might need for the new semester? Well, we have. Here are some of our favorite and suggested tech products that might help you with your studies or make dorm room life a little more comfortable.

 Obviously, there's a need to be sensible and pack all the equipment you need to help you learn, but don't forget about the downtime. When you're not studying away, it helps to destress and relax, so it's important to pack a little entertainment alongside the study aids to help unwind.

 The picks in this list are things we have reviewed and/or tried out ourselves to see if they perform as advertised and offer good value for money. If possible, we've also listed the deal price if the item is currently on sale at a discounted price.

 **My favorite back-to-school tech items for the new term:**

## Audio

 For some people, audio might not spring to mind as one of the most important considerations when you're off to college. But if you end up staying in your dorm room for long periods, or spend a lot of time traveling to and from school, having a way to relax to your favorite tunes or listen to an audiobook on a long journey is one of the best ways to pass the time.

 From speakers to over-the-ear headphones to earbuds, there are plenty of options for you to choose from, and many of them are not as expensive as you might think - which is always a good thing.

## SoundPeats Space Wireless Headset

![SoundPeats Space Wireless Bluetooth Headphones](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F24Yi3THXF7HJqJq2hj54R-320-80.jpg)

 (Image credit: SoundPeats)

 The SoundPeats Space wireless headset is a very affordable and surprisingly great-sounding wireless Bluetooth 5.3 over-the-ear headset. It's super light and primarily constructed of lightweight yet sturdy plastic with a reinforced steel headband. Contained in the over-the-ear earcups are 40mm dynamic drivers that provide a surprisingly punchy bass and clear highs. When used on devices with the included 3.5mm cable the headphones are capable of playing back Hi-Res audio if the content is up to the standard.

 I've taken these cans for a spin at the gym and on long walks and they've performed brilliantly, the active noise canceling works extremely well for such a moderately priced pair of headphones, with the passive and normal mode also performing up to par. The battery lasts about 60 hours if kept in ANC mode, but in normal mode, the battery will last up to 123 hours on a single charge. These headphones are ideal for listening to music or a movie if you're sharing a room and connect to so many devices with its Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. There's even a low-latency game mode that offers a connection as low as 65ms helping to keep your sound and game in sync.

## Audeze Maxwell Wireless Gaming Headset

![Audeze Maxwell](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSTGdDtzE75XGJYehdsD6g-320-80.jpg)

 (Image credit: Audeze)

 If you're more of an audiophile and insist on having the clearest sound profiles beamed straight into your ears then the Audeze Maxwell is one headset that you certainly want to consider putting on your shopping list. We've had the chance to try out and[review the Audeze Maxwell](https://tools.techidaily.com) and it ranks as one of our favorite gaming headsets.

 This gorgeous headset is a gamer's dream with super-comfortable memory foam earpads and headband. It's surprisingly comfortable to wear for long periods, as this premium headset is not lightweight. Coming in at 490 grams it is a hefty monster of a headset, and that's primarily thanks to its very sturdy metal construction and giant 90mm planar magnetic drivers housed in the oversized earcups. The headset was light on my head with minimal clamping force, but I did notice it felt like it wanted to fall off if I leaned too far forward or backward. Another big plus was how comfy it was to wear with glasses, which can always be an issue with headsets and glasses wearers.

 There are two versions of Audeze's Maxwell headset, a PlayStation and Xbox variant, with both versions working on PC and each version working on their respective consoles. Connectivity-wise the Maxwell uses Bluetooth 5.3, 2.4GHz wireless, USB-C, and 3.5mm Aux. Charging is very fast, only taking about 20 minutes and giving up to 80 hours of listening time. I can confirm that the sound these cans produce is amazing and certainly the best of any gaming headsets I've had the chance to try so far. Listening to movies, and music, and playing games is crystal clear with superb reproduction.

## Entertainment

 When you need a break from your studies, to unwind and relax, either by yourself or with a couple of friends, there's always a use for a little entertainment to provide some much needed stimuli.

 Computer games are a great way to pass the time and take your mind off of the hard work you've been doing, and games consoles, gaming PCs or gaming laptops are are good options for playing games and other media.

## PlayStation 5

 Sony's PlayStation 5 console is winning the console wars in terms of unit sales and successful exclusive game titles even though it's not the most attractive-looking console. Perfect for a bit of couch co-op action after classes, the PS5 is similar in raw power to its Xbox rival but does feature the advantage of not having to buy a proprietary piece of hardware if you want to expand on the 1TB of storage already included with the console. To upgrade the available storage in the PlayStation 5 you can purchase a standard M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD as long as the stats meet the stated basic requirements for PS5 operation.

## Storage

 Is there ever enough storage? Probably... but if like me you're a data hoarder, you never uninstall all those photos, videos, and games. Plus, once you're off to college or back at school, having enough space to do perform and store your work is essential.

 From popping more SSD's in your computer, or upgrading capacities, to portable storage solutions for easily transporting or backing up your important work, storage is something you should certainly consider or have at the ready.

 Compact and tiny, the the Crucial X9 is a portable SSD that fits snuggly in the palm of your hand. For some reason I always thought these drives were bigger and similar in size to the 2.5" external HDD drives - but they're not.

 Packed inside the tiny rugged chassis is a 1TB SSD, with 2TB and 4TB options available. Using a Gen 2 USB 3.2 Type-C connection the X9 has access to the 10Gb/s interface and shows transfer speeds of 1050MB/s.

 This little drive is easy to transport and store and is the perfect solution for backing up your data, and for storing photos, videos, or music. Hey... even your course work.

## Crucial X10 Portable SSD

![Crucial X10 Pro 1TB External SSD](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpEAYHfyHPHNxwmQPeCSF4-320-80.jpg)

 (Image credit: Crucial)

 Crucial's X10 Pro external SSD is the same size as the previously mentioned X9, but has a few improvements - namely it's twice as fast - with a Gen-2 2x2 USB 3.2 Type-C connection capable of 20Gb/s with sequential read and write speeds 2100/2000MB/s.

 The rugged chassis is also rated for IP55 water and dust resistance, and should protect your data even when dropped from height, as long as it's not over 7.5 feet. Although, one of my favorite improvements is the simple addition of a keychain/lanyard loop on the drive chassis, making transportation so much easier and also decreasing the chances of your misplacing the drive.

 We had the chance to[review the X10 Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com) and put it through it's paces, even awarding it an Editor's Choice award for its exceptional performance for an external USB drive.

## USB Hubs and Docks

 Let's face it, there are never enough available USB-C ports on your computer whether it's a laptop or desktop PC, and with the number of devices - especially peripherals - using USB-C becoming more commonplace a USB hub is an essential piece of kit.

 I've been using hubs and docking stations for years to easily connect to devices, and I don't know what I'd do without them. Unless motherboard manufacturers or laptop makers start shipping their products with tons more included ports, hubs will be the only option.

## Keyboard and Mouse

 You're more than likely going to be using a computer a lot in your new year at school or college and whether it's a laptop or desktop, you want to have the best experience possible when using them. Something to seriously consider is what you're using the computer for, and the ergonomics of your setup. Adding a new mouse, keyboard, or even a wrist rest is a great way of improving your computer setup and can potentially even reduce the risks of any repetitive strain injuries you could incur from excessive computer use.

 With its light and dark gray graphite styling (also available in Black and Pale Gray), the MX Keys S is an attractive keyboard that will look great on any desk. The MX Keys doesn’t boast per-key RGB like most modern day gaming keyboards, but instead has white backlighting, which it uses a proximity sensor located on the keyboard’s bottom edge which measures the magnetic field around the peripheral. The MX Keys S notices when your hands are touching the keyboard and lights up the keys without you having to press a button which is pretty cool.

 As well as multi-device Bluetooth connectivity and a comfortable ergonomic typing experience, the Logitech MX Keys S is a productivity workhorse and ideal for lots of essay/ report typing.

## Logitech MX Master 3S

![Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Mouse](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u664eJMBpQNnX76znUeXSV-320-80.png)

 There are more considerations than you might think when choosing the mouse that's right for you. What type of grip you have and your hand size are just a few of the things that you should consider.

 If it's a lot of productivity work such as school/college coursework then you should go for something ergonomic that's going to provide comfortable use over long periods, but, if it's primarily for gaming use then you would want a sensor with a high DPI, polling rate, and acceleration.

 Logitech's MX variants of peripherals have been around for a good while and the latest MX Master 3S offers a tried and tested design. With a large-ish size and comfortable ergonomics, the MX Master 3S is already a popular choice for professionals.

## Monitor

 For work or play a monitor is a good option for a screen above choosing a television as they can often be cheaper, have more connectivity choices, and vary in size. Perfect for setting up in a small dorm room over a 55-50-inch TV.

 If you want something just for work, to maybe hook up to a laptop for a bigger screen, you might want to look for something with a DisplayPort over USB-C, if you have a desktop then anything with an HDMI or DisplayPort should do the trick. Then it's just a case of budget and the type of screen and resolution you'd like to go for.
