## Beginner's Guide: The Ultimate List of 5 Must-Have Mobile Apps for Learning Code

###### [Read update](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-game-recording-made-easy-with-xbox-one-capture-techniques/) 

* Unfortunately, since we published this article, the Grasshopper app has been removed from the Play Store following Google stopping its development in 2023\. Please check out the other apps on this list while we look for an alternative.

 Wouldn’t it be the best thing in the world if you could learn to code with an app on your phone? There are actually a few apps out there that help you do just that.

 When you ask programmers how they [learned to code](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/toms-computing-a-comprehensive-guide-on-latest-hardware-innovations/), many of them will say they learned using an app. Apps make coding more straightforward and more accessible than ever before. You don’t need a PC, and you can complete a lesson in a few minutes daily. Here, we’ll look at five great apps for beginners to start their coding journey.

##  Grasshopper

[Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app/)

###  UPDATE: 2024/02/02 09:26 EST

 Unfortunately, since we published this article, the Grasshopper app has been removed from the Play Store following Google stopping its development in 2023\. Please check out the other apps on this list while we look for an alternative.

 This application was originally designed by the team at Code with Google. It’s based around [teaching users how to code in JavaScript](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/google-grasshopper-app-teaches-adults-202424024.html) and does a pretty good job with it. I found the games engaging, and some of them were fun. The puzzles are great for passing a few minutes, and they’ll have you thinking like a programmer before you know it. Learning to code with Grasshopper is free, but the app is only available to Android users (sorry, iPhone users).

 Unfortunately, the downside of Grasshopper is that you only get to learn JavaScript. While it will teach you what you need to know as a beginner, it doesn’t give you much past the beginner level. You can develop a lesson plan that will get you to the intermediate level, but after that, you’ll have to strike out on your own to find something more challenging.

##  Khan Academy

Close 

 Khan Academy is an [online learning institution](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-code-lessons/hour-of-drawing-code/a/how-we-teach-coding-on-ka), and its application is a blueprint to go from zero to programmer with all the support you’ll need. Its learning library is robust and covers several different languages. It doesn’t matter if you want to learn JavaScript, Python, or R. I was impressed by the level of tutorials I got when checking out this app. There are coding tutorials that cover most of the basics. It’s also free to learn how to code on this app. Luckily, both Android and iPhone users can access this one.

 The downside of such a broad learning spectrum is that the interaction leaves something to be desired. There are a lot of resources, so unless you have an idea of what you want to learn from the get-go, it can be very daunting to pick out a course you want to do. If you’re easily sidetracked, Khan Academy might distract you more than teach you.

##  Encode

 What if you could get a coding lesson while on the bus or waiting for a taxi? Encode offers to teach you the basics of full-stack development in bite-sized lessons. The short lesson length was really engaging, and I found myself coming back to it just when I had nothing to do during the day. It’s also free, but there’s a premium version that users could pay for. Encode covers CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Python. The app is available for both Android and iPhones.

 Encode offers a great way to get up to speed on the basics of full-stack development. It even offers review options to go back to things you’re unclear about. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have a clear pathway from beginner to intermediate. While the lessons are super engaging, they can also be too short for you to actually remember anything.

##  Enki

Close 

 If you want to become a data scientist, [Enki](https://www.enki.com/start) is what you should use to learn coding. I liked how approachable the interface was with this app, making me feel like I wanted to learn more. Enki uses really engaging tools like quizzes and coding challenges and offers a robust content library. You can even get someone in data science to mentor your code and tell you what they would have done differently. The app is free, with a few in-app purchases to support the company. Enki is also available to both iPhone and Android users.

 While Enki is an excellent place for beginners, it’s also not geared towards teaching every beginner how to code. The language selections are helpful, but they focus primarily on data science and learning how to code secondarily. If you’re looking for something fun and light, Enki might be a bit much for you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Enki isn’t the only way to learn about data science. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) offers a simple way to learn R, Python, and SQL engagingly. I really got into the interface, and while it’s made for beginner programmers, it doesn’t hold your hand as you get into the more complex parts of your learning journey. DataCamp was built for learners of all skill levels, so there’s something for everyone. The app is free but offers in-app purchases for several bonuses. DataCamp is available on both iPhone and Android devices.

 DataCamp is one of the best ways to learn complicated languages like R, but it’s built with a focus on data science. The languages it offers are all data-science-centric, meaning that beginners who want a broader base to expand on will be disappointed. It offers something for everyone, but it's mostly self-guided, and you have to know what you want to learn.

##  What’s the Best App for Learning Coding?

 Beginner coders have a lot of [awesome apps and websites they can learn to code](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/navigating-gif-storage-and-use-in-the-digital-age-iphone/) from. To make the most of your coding journey, you should decide whether you want to learn it for a job or as a hobby. You should look at what you want to do with it and what level of experience you want from the app.

 These apps are only a few of the hundreds offered on the app stores for both iPhone and Android. They were apps that I used myself so I could help you understand what you’re getting into. If they aren’t what you’re looking for, you have many options in either of these stores to experiment with. After all, that’s one of the things programmers love to do – experimenting until we find something that works.
