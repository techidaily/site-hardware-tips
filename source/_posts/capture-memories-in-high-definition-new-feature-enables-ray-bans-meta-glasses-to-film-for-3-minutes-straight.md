## Capture Memories in High Definition: New Feature Enables Ray-Ban's Meta Glasses to Film for 3 Minutes Straight!

After launching in 2021, the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses quickly became the most recognizable and well-known smart glasses on the market. Still, Meta is finding new ways to improve its fresh frames, and the latest improvement is a much-needed three-minute video recording option.

 This improvement comes courtesy of the v6.0 update, which is rolling out today. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses previously enforced a one-minute limitation on video recordings—today's update extends the limitation threefold.

 Realistically, most Meta Smart Glasses owners don't _need_ to record three-minute videos, which is why this option needs to be manually enabled in settings. Recording time was never a problem in [our review](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/safari-on-iphone-running-slow-learn-how-to-make-it-zoom-ahead-in-just-4-steps/), as we mainly used the glasses to capture short memories. We also found ourselves taking more photos than videos.

 Still, some people will benefit from the extended recording time, and the old one-minute limitation was certainly listed as a complaint among some customers. And if a three-minute video proves to be excessively long, it can always be edited down to a shorter length.

 Battery life and privacy concerns were (probably) responsible for Meta Smart Glasses' limited recording time at launch. Now that the glasses are a few years old, battery life is under less scrutiny, and zealous privacy advocates have turned their attention elsewhere (plus, the idea of filming people without their knowledge has become normalized). In any case, the battery life of these glasses hasn't improved, and recording three-minute videos will drain the battery _very_ quickly.

 Along with an extended recording time, the v6.0 update adds support for native Amazon Music streaming (only when paired with an iPhone, for some reason) and the Calm mindfulness app.

 All of these new capabilities must be enabled in the Meta View app. So, after installing the v6.0 update, enter your camera settings to turn on three-minute video recordings. As for the new audio app integrations, go into Music and connect to whichever services you want.

 Your Meta Smart Glasses should automatically update by default. If you've disabled automatic updates, or if your glasses refuse to update on their own, you can trigger a manual update from the Meta View app.
