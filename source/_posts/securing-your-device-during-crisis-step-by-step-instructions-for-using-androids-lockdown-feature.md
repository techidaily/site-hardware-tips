 Every Android device has a lock screen with some sort of security. Most of the time, that's enough--- but what if you want a little extra security? That's where the "Lockdown" feature comes in.

##  What Is "Lockdown" on Android?

 There are a handful of security methods you can use to prevent someone from getting into your Android phone. However, not all of these methods are secure as others.

 For example, the face unlock on many Android devices [is surprisingly easy to fool](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-can-i-use-a-fake-gps-without-mock-location-on-vivo-v29-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). You may also have some Bluetooth devices that unlock the phone. The most secure Android unlocking methods are the PIN, pattern, and password.

 When you put the phone into "Lockdown," it disables all those less-secure unlock methods. The fingerprint scanner, face unlock, and [Smart Lock](https://howto.techidaily.com/fixes-for-apps-keep-crashing-on-vivo-v27e-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) are completely disabled. Only the PIN, pattern, and password can be used.

 This is handy in a situation where you need to quickly secure your device. With a single tap, you can essentially add an extra layer of security.

##  How to Enable Lockdown Mode on Android

 The Lockdown feature is available on Android devices with version 9 and higher. On Google Pixel devices, the button is available in the power menu by default. [Samsung Galaxy](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-connecting-consciously-with-content-craftsmen-of-your-realm-for-2024/) owners need to enable it first.

 Swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings tiles. Tap the gear icon to open the Settings.
