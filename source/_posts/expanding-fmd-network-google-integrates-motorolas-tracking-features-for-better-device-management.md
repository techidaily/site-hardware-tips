## Expanding FMD Network, Google Integrates Motorolaâ€™s Tracking Features for Better Device Management

Motorola just launched the Moto Tag, a Bluetooth tracker that matches the design and capabilities of Apple's AirTag. The only substantial difference, aside from a unique multifunction button, is that Moto Tag is designed for Android.

 In case you missed it, Google recently launched its Find My Device tracking network for smartphones, earbuds, trackers, and other devices. Every Android phone can report location data to the Find My Device network, meaning that it has the potential to be far more effective than the networks utilized by Tile or Samsung devices.

 Moto Tag is one of the first Bluetooth trackers to join the Find My Device system. It's also the first Android tracker to offer [ultra-wideband](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-realme-c67-4g-by-drfone-android/) (UWB) precision tracking (which is also featured in [Apple's AirTag](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/mastering-comfortable-virtual-realities-for-2024/)). When you're in the same room as the Moto Tag, your phone can guide you to its exact location, even if it's tucked between couch cushions or sitting at the bottom of a bagâ€”this only works with UWB-capable smartphones, but it's a fantastic feature.

Motorola

 In terms of basic design, Moto Tag is nearly a clone of the AirTag. Both trackers are small and circular, without any keyring holes. They both contain user-replaceable CR2032 batteries, and they both sport an IP67 rating for sand and water immersion resistance. Interestingly, Motorola says that Moto Tag "was designed to fit perfectly with most third-party accessories," which leads me to believe that it can fit in AirTag cases (though this hasn't been explicitly confirmed).

 However, Moto Tag isn't a straight-up AirTag clone. It features an interesting multifunction button that can set off your phone's ringer, trigger your phone's camera shutter, and perform other tasks. I doubt that this will be useful in _all_ situations, but it could certainly be useful when the Moto Tag is attached to a keyring.

 I should take this opportunity to mention [Chipolo's](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-taking-your-videos-to-the-next-level-expert-pc-methods-for-youtubers/) tracking devices, which offer the same basic Find My Device functionality as the Moto Tag but come in more unique form factors.

 Motorola will begin selling the Moto Tag on August 2nd. A single tag costs $29 while a four-pack is $99â€”yep, Motorola copied Apple's pricing, and I'm glad to see it.
