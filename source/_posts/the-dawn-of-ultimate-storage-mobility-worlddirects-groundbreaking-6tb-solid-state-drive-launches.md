## The Dawn of Ultimate Storage Mobility - WorldDirect's Groundbreaking 6TB Solid State Drive Launches

Several Western Digital hard drives, including the My Passport Ultra and WD\_BLACK P10 Game Drive, are now available in 6TB flavors. These are the first 2.5-inch portable HDDs ever offered in a 6TB capacity, and they're relatively inexpensive, too.

 In most situations where you need a ‌_portable_ drive, a 6TB HDD is kind of an odd choice. A speedy SSD is the more typical option, as anyone who wants a 6TB capacity is usually working with large files or doing creative work that involves frequent file transfers. Nevertheless, HDDs are more affordable than SSDs, and if you don't need super-speedy file transfer, an HDD may be perfectly appropriate for your professional or creative applications.

 The WD My Passport (and My Passport Ultra) are the cheapest of these 6TB drives. WD My Passport is relatively durable and supports USB 3.0 speeds for transfer rates up to 5Gbps, so it's a good option for most users, even in professional settings.

 Naturally, the WD\_Black P10 Game Drive is intended for gaming. It's an on-the-go storage option for PC games, though it can also be a permanent companion to your game console. The WD-Black P10 boasts USB 3.0 speeds of 5Gbps.

 If you need something more durable, the SanDisk Professional’s G-DRIVE ArmorATD is ideal. It sports an IP54 water and dust resistance rating, plus pressure resistance up to 1,000 pounds and rubberized exterior. It has the same 5Gbps transfer rate as these other drives, of course.

 Note that all of these drive models come with a [three-year limited warranty](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003202/https://www.westerndigital.com/support/store/warranty-policy). They also feature built-in encryption and password protection.

 Western Digital's new 6TB portable HDDs are available today. Pricing ranges from $180 to $230, depending on which model of 6TB HDD you purchase. Note that some of these products, including the 6TB SanDisk Professional's G-DRIVE ArmorATD, won't be available until the end of May.
