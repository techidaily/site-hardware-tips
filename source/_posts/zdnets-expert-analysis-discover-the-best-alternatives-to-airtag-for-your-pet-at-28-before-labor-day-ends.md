Petcube recently launched a new [Petcube GPS Tracker](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPetcube-Location-Activity-Wellness-Monitoring%2Fdp%2FB0C89SV8VP%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca39f990b-774e-45c3-82a9-3a7e0842bc57%7Cdtp&dtb=1) that lets you monitor your dog's location. The tracker fits into a silicon case on a dog's collar. The device, which has an LED light and a beeper controlled via the Petcube app, is also waterproof.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Petcube GPS Tracker Not only does the Petcube GPS Tracker give you peace of mind with real-time location tracking, it also tracks activity and connects you to a chat with a vet for the odd health and behavioral question.

Anyone who has raised a puppy likely knows the heart-dropping panic of having a little fur ball scurry past your legs through an open door. This is typically followed by a panicked owner chasing a dog that has yet to master recall and is fueled by a lack of common sense and a desire to wreak havoc, as puppies usually do.

My dog is now two years old, and although his recall is somewhat reliable thanks to training, he still prefers a good two minutes of freedom to poop in the neighbor's yard rather than immediately returning to me after I call him when he gets out. 

The Petcube GPS Tracker gives me peace of mind that I'll be able to find my dog if he wanders post poop, but also if I take him hiking or exploring in the woods behind my house.

I don't let my dog out unleashed beyond our fenced-in yard, but this tracker also lets me set safe zones through geofencing. If my dog leaves those safe zones, the Petcube alerts me with a phone notification. This alert lets me rest easily, knowing he's always where he should be.

Although I'm always working on training my dog out of his crazed puppy antics, I like the idea of him having a GPS tracker to prevent him from getting lost and to strengthen his recall. The Petcube GPS Tracker has a beeper that you can ring on the Petcube app from your smartphone. I'm currently teaching my dog to find me when he hears the beep, so he learns that beeping equates to me calling him.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The device fits my medium, 35-pound dog well, but its 2.3" x 0.9" x 0.7" size and almost three ounces in weight could be too big for some small dogs.

This GPS tracker also offers activity monitoring, which tracks your pet's burned calories, activity time, and distance walked, all with historical data. When you enter your dog's information, including its weight, the app will recommend a daily goal of activity time to keep your dog healthy and happy.

A dog fitness tracker might not be a priority for many pet owners, but it can be a welcome addition for people who like to work out with their pets or those with a pup that needs to lose weight. The historical data is a fun addition that gives the GPS tracker extra functionality.

The Petcube GPS Tracker is waterproof and comes with a magnetic charger.

The biggest downside to the Petcube GPS tracker is that it requires a monthly subscription starting at $5 per month. The subscription includes GPS and activity tracking, access to the Petcube Tracker's features, such as the built-in light and beeper, and even a Vet Online chat consult, which gives you access to a licensed veterinarian in the app -- for the next time Fido chews on that weird plant from the neighbor's yard.

Petcube offers different subscription options, from a basic to a premium one, with monthly or annual payments. You can even pay for up to five years in advance. At the end of the day, though, it's another subscription added to your list of monthly payments.

He looks far calmer in pictures than in real life -- he's a runner.

I like how I can always see precisely where my dog is and that I have peace of mind thanks to tracking his steps via "Lost Pet Mode," a high-sensitivity tracking mode you can activate when you think you've lost your dog. After testing the device for over a week, I'd recommend the [Petcube GPS Tracker](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPetcube-Location-Activity-Wellness-Monitoring%2Fdp%2FB0C89SV8VP%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca39f990b-774e-45c3-82a9-3a7e0842bc57%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for finding your pets quickly and easily via GPS, as long as you don't mind paying for a subscription.

If you're looking to avoid a recurring fee, you could opt for an [AirTag](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX532AM-A-AirTag%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca39f990b-774e-45c3-82a9-3a7e0842bc57%7Cdtp&dtb=1) with [a waterproof case](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWaterproof-Airtag-Ultra-Durable-Collars-Pack-Black%2Fdp%2FB0BGH2P4JQ%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca39f990b-774e-45c3-82a9-3a7e0842bc57%7Cdtp&dtb=1), as is common practice for some pet owners. The AirTag doesn't use GPS. Instead, the device employs the iPhone's Find My network to communicate its location. This approach means an AirTag has the risk of not being found in remote locations with no iPhones nearby, such as if you go hiking or camping and lose your dog.
