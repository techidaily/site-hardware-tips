## The New Intel Kingpin: Core I7-14700K Shines with a 7% Single-Core Supremacy over Competitor Core Ultra 7 - Arrow Lake Chip Dominates Benchmarks

Another upcoming Arrow Lake chip, which will compete against the[best CPUs](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html) , has appeared for the first time in the Geekbench browser. This time, it pertains to the iGPUless Core Ultra 7 265KF. Discovered by[Benchleaks on X](https://x.com/BenchLeaks/status/1817097462177235414) , the chip was benchmarked in Geekbench 5.5.1 (the source of the results has now been pulled). It boasts good single-core performance but falters in multi-core performance, lagging behind the last-generation[Core i7-14700K](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review) .

 The Core Ultra 7 265KF scored 2,252 points in the Geekbench 5 single-core test and 17,722 points in the multi-core test. Single-core performance is competitive with Intel's previous generation Core i7 and Core i9 K-series parts, 7% faster than the Core i7-14700KF and 3% faster than the Core i9-14900K. However, compared to an Arrow Lake-S qualification sample, which we believe to be a Core Ultra 9 285K, the Ultra 7 model loses out, with the Arrow Lake-S qualification sample being 9% quicker in single-threaded performance.

 Multi-core performance is where the Core Ultra 7 265KF completely faulters. Compared to the Core i7-14700KF — its direct predecessor, the Raptor Lake Refresh chip beats the 265KF by a whopping 16%. It only gets worse against the higher-trim models. The Core i9-14900K outperforms the 265KF by 45%, and the Arrow Lake-S (Ultra 9 285K) QS beats the 265KF by 54%. Results for the Core i9 and Core i7 models were taken from the first page of results in the Geekbench 5 browser and averaged together.

| CPU                            | Single-Core | Multi-Core |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Arrow Lake-S QS (Ultra 9 285K) | 2,455       | 27,381     |
| Core i9-14900K                 | 2,178       | 25,648     |
| **Core Ultra 7 265KF**         | **2,252**   | **17,722** |
| Core i7-14700KF                | 2,102       | 20,480     |

 The Geekbench listing reveals that the Core Ultra 7 265KF has eight P-cores and 12 E-cores, with clock speeds reaching up to 5.4 GHz. The addition of the "F" nomenclature also suggests the chip has a disabled integrated graphics unit. Compared to the rumored specs of the Core Ultra 9 285K, the 265KF has four fewer E-cores but the same number of P-cores.

 As always, take these results with a pinch of salt. The conditions in which the Core Ultra 7 was running are unknown. However, we won't see what Arrow Lake is capable of until in a few months, as Intel's next-generation chips have been rumored to launch in October, while AMD's Ryzen 9000 lineup is just right around the corner.
