##  How to Activate Dark Mode in Microsoft Office for Android

 To enable dark mode in Office on Android, first, launch the official Microsoft Office app on your Android phone. In the app, at the top-left corner, tap the user icon.

![Tap the user icon in the Microsoft Office app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-office-user-icon.png) 

 A "Me" screen will open. Here, from the "More" section, select "Settings." This opens the settings menu for Office.

 In the "Settings" menu, under the "Display Preferences" section, tap "Theme."

![Tap "Theme" on the "Settings" page in Microsoft Office.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-office-theme.png) 

 You'll now see various appearance options for Office. To apply dark mode, select "Dark."

 A prompt will appear saying that you need to restart the app to bring changes into effect. To close this prompt, tap "Got It."

 To reverse your action and go back to the default light mode, open the "Theme" menu again and choose "Light." Then close and re-open the app.
