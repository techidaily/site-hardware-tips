##  What to Look For in a NAS Device for Plex

[Plex](https://network-issues.techidaily.com/instantly-eradicate-playback-problems/) is an incredible piece of software. At its core, Plex is all about giving you an easy way to access your favorite media—aggregating all your TV shows and movies into a single unified location. Plex can be run directly off your laptop or desktop, but if you're looking to create a more robust setup, picking up a NAS (network-attached storage) device is essential.

 Not all NAS devices are up to the task of hosting your Plex server. That means you'll need to be careful about which ones you pick. To make things easy, you can simply check out the massive [NAS database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfYoJkiwSqCXg8cm5-Ac4oOLPRtCkgUxU0jdj3tmMPc/edit#gid=1274624273) put together by Plex. Using this, you can hone in on which products support which features.

 Ideally, you'll want something with [hardware-accelerated transcoding](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-guide-to-verifying-your-youtube-profile/). This allows the device to stream media without stuttering or lagging. Different devices support different levels of hardware-accelerated transcoding, with some capable of offering the service for 4K footage, while others only support up to 1080p footage. Whatever the case, be sure to pay attention to this when picking up a device.

 You'll also want to pay attention to its RAM and number of bays. The more RAM you have, the better it can handle all your data. And the more bays you have, the more options you'll have for expansion. It's also important to consider built-in ports (such as HDMI and GbE), allowing you to quickly output to different devices or connect to an existing system.

 Other factors to weigh include warranties and backup software, though most NAS devices nowadays are adequate on both accounts. But if you're nervous about losing your data, take a closer look at these to ensure you have the proper coverage.

 To help you sift through the hundreds of options, here's a look at the best NAS devices for Plex. These run the gamut from affordable, entry-level devices to ultra-premium products designed for enthusiasts. They also span PC and Mac, ensuring there's a NAS setup for you regardless of your rig.

##  Best NAS for Plex Overall: [Asustor AS5202T](https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5202T-Inspired-Attached-Dual-Core/dp/B07PW9DV56?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001147&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices-plex%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Asustor AS5202T on desk](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Asustor-AS5202T.jpg) 

Asustor

| Pros                              | Cons                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Certified compatibility with Plex | Plex Pass required for most features |
| Supports 4K footage               | Aggressive "gamer aesthetic"         |
| HDMI output                       |                                      |
| Expandable RAM                    |                                      |

 It looks a bit quirky compared to other NAS devices, but the [Asustor AS5202T](https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5202T-Inspired-Attached-Dual-Core/dp/B07PW9DV56?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001147&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices-plex%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is perfect for Plex. Clocking in at a reasonable price and offering dedicated hardware-accelerated transcoding, it's an ideal setup for Plex that won't ruin your wallet.

 The fact that the AS5202T offers hardware-accelerated transcoding is a big deal, as this feature is typically reserved for much more expensive products. It's also a key feature to look for in NAS devices for Plex, as it ensures you'll get smooth playback when streaming your content. You'll need a Plex Pass subscription to make full use of it—though there's a good chance anyone looking for a NAS for Plex is already a member.

 The AS5202T also benefits from 4K HDR support, an HDMI output so you can quickly connect to a display, and expandable RAM if you ever want to ramp up its performance. And while the two-bay version will suffice for most users, folks with a massive library can spring for a [four-bay unit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY2KTRW/ref=twister%5FB0CFR47VWR?%5Fencoding=UTF8&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001147&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices-plex%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) (though it's quite a bit more expensive).

 All told, you're not likely to find a NAS device for Plex that offers the same combination of affordability and power that you'll get with the Asustor AS5202T. Consider giving it a look if you're hoping to move Plex off your desktop or laptop and onto something more robust and with plenty of room to grow.

Terramaster

| Pros                          | Cons           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Great price                   | Only two bays  |
| 4GB RAM that can be expanded  | No HDMI output |
| Offers several backup options |                |

 Plex requires certain specifications to run properly on a NAS device, so you won't want to lower your budget too far when searching for a good product. The [TerraMaster F2-223](https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F2-223-2Bay-NAS-Storage/dp/B0BF4SWHQN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001147&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices-plex%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is about as affordable as it gets, clocking in at just over $250, yet still robust enough to handle Plex.

 With 4GB RAM, that's upgradeable to 32GB, it's a solid choice right out of the box yet gives you plenty of room to grow. It also supports up to 40TB of storage, so you shouldn't have any problem holding all your content. Other useful features include 4K hardware transcoding and two 2.5GbE ports to sync with existing systems. Best of all, it comes with several integrated backup solutions, ensuring your files are always safe.

 There are a few downsides to this budget NAS, including its lack of bays. There's also no HDMI output, though both are minor caveats for an otherwise impressive product. Consider giving it a look if you're just starting on your Plex journey and want to move your collection to a dedicated system.

QNAP

| Pros                              | Cons            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Sleek design                      | Expensive       |
| Four bays for incredible capacity | Large footprint |
| 4K transcoding                    |                 |
| 4GB RAM                           |                 |

 Already running Plex off a NAS system and looking for an upgrade? Then you'll need to check out the [QNAP TS-464-8G-US Four Bay NAS](https://www.amazon.com/QNAP-TS-464-8G-US-High-Performance-Quad-core-Connectivity/dp/B0BQ5TWCL8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001147&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-nas-devices-plex%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Its name is nothing short of terrible—but beyond that awkward name is a premium NAS.

 No corners were cut when designing the TS-464, as it features four bays, two 2.5GbE ports, HDMI output, and four USB ports (two 2.0 and two 3.2 Gen 2). That gives you plenty of ways to integrate it with other gear and makes it quite futureproof. You'll also get 4GB RAM and support for 4K output, as well as support for [NetBak Replicator](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/utilities/essentials) and [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102423) backup software.

 Toss in hardware-accelerated transcoding for smooth playback, and it's easy to see why the TS-464 is a popular NAS for Plex.

 There are a few drawbacks to this product, the most obvious of which is its price. It's also quite large and requires a fair chunk of space on your desktop. But considering everything else it has to offer, those should be fairly easy to overlook.

| Pros                         | Cons                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Four-bay capacity            | Expensive                           |
| Works with Mac               | Might be excessive for casual users |
| DiskStation Manager Software |                                     |

 The [Synology DiskStation DS423+](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1757288-REG/synology%5Fdiskstation%5Fds423%5F4%5Fbay%5Fnas.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU2001147) is a bit expensive, but it's a great option for Mac users. Along with native support for Finder, it uses the DiskStation Manager OS to help manage your network. That makes it great to use with Mac, as you can quickly navigate all your content without frustration.

 Another big win for the DS423+ is that it offers software and hardware-accelerated transcoding for Plex. This ensures smooth, stutter-free playback and a smooth viewing experience. Not all NAS products offer this, so it's a great inclusion.

 Other notable features include four bays for plenty of expansion room, two gigabit Ethernet ports, read speeds up to 226 MB/s, and write speeds up to 224 MB/s. The price and four bays might be overkill for casual users, but if you're willing to shell out for a robust Plex setup on Mac, this is the product to get.
