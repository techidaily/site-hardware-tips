 In our review, we noted how the lack of a fully automated build platform leveling system stood out as a step backward from the previous generation Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, but the dramatic increase in print speeds (up to a maximum printing speed of 500mm/s) thanks to the linear rods and massive cooling fan to help prints cool quicker more than made up for it.

 The Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro offers an impressive list of features including a cooling fan (for large parts) mounted to the X-axis, a direct-drive extruder with a 5.2:1 gear reduction ratio, Klipper firmware, and more. Assembly of this printer is also very easy as it comes largely assembled, and only takes a moment to fully construct; plus all the tools you need to get creating are included in the box.
