## Cut Down on Screen Strain with the Compact, Multicolor E-Ink Monitor From Dasung

Dasung has boldly planted its flag in the world of full-color E Ink computer monitors. The company is now launching a portable E-Ink monitor, the Paperlike Color, which promises to relieve eyestrain and reduce power consumption when working on the go.

 Color E-Ink has ballooned in popularity over the past few years. This is primarily due to falling prices, though it's also the result of [technological improvements](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/breakthrough-visuals-hp-envy-27-monitors-4k-showcase/). Early color eReaders looked unimpressive and sold at prices of $1,000 or more, but you can now find some very compelling color eReaders for [as little as $150](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/mycam-review-a-step-toward-future-proofing-your-videos/).

 The potential benefits of an E-Ink computer monitor were noted as far back as [the 1990s](https://medium.com/@supernote/the-history-of-electronic-paper-cdafa0d6cc38). E-Ink panels are said to greatly reduce eyestrain and fatigue, as they do not emit light and tend to boast a higher resolution than similarly-priced LCDs—the Dasung clocks in at 150 PPI in color mode and 300 PPI in black and white mode. For professionals who deal with static documents or text, a product like the [Dasung Paperlike Color](https://shop.dasung.com/products/the-worlds-first-portable-color-e-ink-monitor-paperlike-color-12-inch) could make work more enjoyable or less headache-inducing.

 That said, E-Ink is still a relatively poor choice for a _consumer_ computer monitor. E-Ink panels refresh at a chugging pace and look bad when scrolling through web pages, watching videos, or performing other actions that require a lot of on-screen movement. They're also far less colorful than LCD or OLED screens, which greatly limits their utility in creative settings.

 And while E-Ink tablets are now quite cheap, E-Ink monitors are undeniably expensive. The new Dasung Paperlike Color costs $849—roughly five times the price of an LCD portable monitor. The high price is likely a consequence of the monitor's Kaleido 3 panel, which offers touchscreen functionality, a "Turbo Refresh" mode for [semi-acceptable](https://youtu.be/2lEpaMEJUJ4?si=q6ftPusmPeP7B4kZ&t=312) video playback, and a relatively large 12-inch viewing area.

 Interestingly, Dasung chose to omit something that would further drive up the monitor's price—a built-in battery. I would normally cite this as a downside, but E-Ink draws so little power that it doesn't matter. If you plug the Dasung Paperlike Color into a laptop, it should have an almost negligible impact on the laptop's battery life.

 Those in need of a Color E Ink monitor for professional work should look into the [Dasung Paperlike Color](https://shop.dasung.com/products/the-worlds-first-portable-color-e-ink-monitor-paperlike-color-12-inch), as it's clearly a capable option. It's just hard to justify the $849 price tag. While this portable monitor is cheaper than Dasung's [E Ink desktop monitors](https://shop.dasung.com/products/dasung-paperlike-color-world-first-color-e-ink-monitor), it's more expensive than an iPad Pro (which can serve as an [external monitor](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/best-anti-tracker-software-for-lenovo-thinkphone-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)). And if you just want a cheap portable monitor, [LCD models](https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VA1655-Portable-Ergonomics-Protective/dp/B09237LL5Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004527&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdasung-portable-e-ink-monitor-launch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) regularly go on sale for less than $100.
