 The Android 15 beta started in February for Google and late May for select OnePlus phones, delivering exciting changes. Later this year, it'll begin rolling out for multiple OnePlus phones. With the OnePlus Android 15 (OxygenOS 15) beta well underway, here's what you need to know.

 As of right now, the [Android 15 beta](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-5-frame-timelapse-recorder-for-2024/) is available on [select Pixel phones](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/mondly-vr-multiplayer-the-future-of-language-learning-in-virtual-reality/), along with the [OnePlus 12 and OnePlus Open](https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712). More models and manufacturers like Samsung will likely [join in later this year](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-universal-unlock-pattern-for-infinix-hot-40-pro-by-drfone-android/). Once the final version is ready for the masses, we expect OxygenOS 15 to hit the OnePlus 12 first before moving on to the rest.

##  When Will OnePlus Release Android 15?

OnePlus

 Remember, the version of Android 15 available right now for select OnePlus phones is only the beta, and it may not be entirely stable for daily use. Before OnePlus officially sends the OxygenOS 15 update (Android 15) out to devices, it'll be fully beta-tested for several months.

 The phone maker is ahead of many other manufacturers, as the OxygenOS 15 beta, based on Android 15, [started in mid-May](https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712). If OnePlus follows its previous update cycle strategies, as it did with Android 14 last year, we anticipate the first update will start rolling out to the public in early to mid-November. Again, that'll likely be for the OnePlus 12 and Open, depending on your region.

 For the beta, those who give it a try can expect multiple updates throughout the summer as OnePlus and Google continue to fine-tune the experience, fix bugs, and integrate new features. Then, in the coming weeks or months, OnePlus will likely add more phones (or the Pad) to the beta program.

 Basically, we expect the OxygenOS 15 beta to end sometime after Google officially releases Android 15, likely around August or September. Then, OnePlus will start finalizing things and sending it to all the eligible devices.

 For example, last year, the OnePlus 11 5G received Android 14 on November 16th in India, then eventually for other regions. Phones like the OnePlus 10, Nord, and more had to wait until December, January, etc. The older OnePlus 9 didn't see it until March 2024 in the United States, and it won't get Android 15 this year. We expect a similar early 2025 arrival of Android 15 for older phones like the OnePlus 10.

##  What to Expect From OxygenOS 15

 The OxygenOS 15 update will deliver many changes and new features from Google, thanks to Android 15, while the rest will come from the developer teams at OnePlus. It'll combine new goodies with UI changes and other advancements.

 The first beta doesn't have a ton of new stuff, but as more betas arrive throughout the summer, we'll have a better idea of what to expect. For example, owners can expect all sorts of AI, naturally. OnePlus devices will be some of the few non-Pixel phones powered by Google's Gemini AI models. That means generative AI controls, text summaries, image editing, and more.

 Regarding Android 15, look for Google's new [private space feature](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-complete-guide-to-oem-unlocking-on-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-by-drfone-android/), battery optimizations, improved security, and [satellite connectivity support](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/identifying-fake-gpt-binco-coins-a-guide-to-recognizing-scams/). The satellite feature might not arrive until OnePlus releases a new phone, but Android 15 brings official support. It'll also be interesting to see how OnePlus integrates Google's new [notification cooldown system](https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/step-by-step-installation-hp-envy-5660-printer-software-get-yours-free/).

 So far, based on the first OnePlus 12 Android 15 beta, we're seeing new lock screen settings and an improved always-on display (AOD) with more options and customization, including a mode similar to Apple's StandBy. OxygenOS 15 also tweaked the notification shade control center, redesigned the volume sliders, and made other minor tweaks throughout.

##  Which OnePlus Phones Will Get Android 15 (And Which Won't)

 Thankfully, while many brands make us wait for months or remain completely silent, OnePlus has [already provided a list](https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1536929304774967301) of which devices will receive the OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) update in 2024-25.

 We know the Android 15 OxygenOS 15 update will start with the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus Open, then for devices like the 11 and 12R. OnePlus [supports its phones](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-photos-from-gionee-f3-pro-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) with major software updates for two, three, or four years, depending on the model. Here's the list of eligible devices:

* **OnePlus 12** and **OnePlus Open** (mid or late November)
* **OnePlus 11, OnePlus 11R, OnePlus 12R** (November-December)
* **OnePlus 10 Pro, OnePlus 10T, OnePlus 10R** (Late December or early 2025)
* **OnePlus Nord 3, Nord CE3, CE3 Lite, Nord CE4**
* **OnePlus Pad**

 Again, these updates will likely start around November and continue into the first 3â€“4 months of next year, with older devices receiving it last. As you probably noticed, several popular older phones are missing and won't get upgraded. Unfortunately, Android 15 will be the company's last major update for multiple phones.

 Phones like the OnePlus 9 and older will not be getting Android 15, nor will the Nord 2 series or the N30\. If your older OnePlus received Android 14, it'll [still get another year](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/in-depth-strategies-to-overcome-teardown-malfunctions-expert-advice/) or so of security and maintenance updates, but not major Android releases.

 While OnePlus confirmed the list of eligible devices, the release dates are only estimates. Things can and will change throughout the Android 15 beta process, and release dates are always subject to change or delays. Furthermore, expect some variances in arrival between different regions or carriers. Either way, Android 15 (OxygenOS 15) is in the works and will be here before you know it.
