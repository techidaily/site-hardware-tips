## Unveiling AMD's Advanced Artificial Intelligence Chip in New ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 Laptop

The ASUS Zephyrus series stands out from the crowd of PC laptops with its high-end hardware, sleek and thin design, and great gaming performance. There’s now a new model on the way with new AMD hardware and the same great design.

 ASUS just announced an updated ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptop (model GA605). The company already [resigned the laptop earlier this year](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-manual-pinning-people-on-snapchat/), and [reviews for the latest model](https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-review/) are generally positive. ASUS is releasing another model with AMD Ryzen AI HX 370 processor, swapping out the Intel Core Ultra chips found in the existing G16\. It will ship with up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.

 The new AMD processor has 12 cores, 24 threads, and a built-in NPU capable of 50 TOPS for AI workloads. That's one of the [Zen 5 processors that AMD just announced](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-infinix-smart-8-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/). Combined with an RTX 4070 graphics card, you get a total of 402 TOPs of AI processing power for [running local AI models](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-infinix-smart-8-pro-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/).

 The Zephryus 16 is designed for more demanding productivity work, such as photo and video editing, as well as PC gaming. The dedicated graphics card can also come in handy for AI workloads, but the Ryzen CPU is supposed to be handle some of that on its own. You also get the same excellent OLED panel as the existing model, and it’s the first ASUS ROG laptop to support Wi-Fi 7.

ASUS

 ASUS said in a press release, “This new AMD platform is packed in the same thin-and-light design that made waves at CES 2024, with an exquisitely crafted CNC-milled aluminum chassis, with a customizable Slash Lighting array on the lid. It also features an ROG Nebula display with an OLED panel that supports NVIDIA G-SYNC®. Its 16:10 aspect ratio, 2.5K resolution, and 240 Hz refresh rate are perfect for gaming and content creation alike, with VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 certification for excellent HDR experiences.”

 The ROG Zephyrus G16 will be available in two hardware configurations from the ASUS online store and other retailers, in both ‘Platinum White’ and ‘Eclipse Gray’ colors. ASUS has not yet confirmed pricing in the United States.
