## How Stratasys' Latest Carbon Fiber Development Could Revolutionize Industry Usage - Insights From ZDNet

Stratasys part made with FDM ABS-CF10 material.

Stratasys said it is launching carbon fiber material for its F123 Series 3D for the first time. 

Carbon fiber materials have been previously reserved for the industrial-strength Stratasys FDM 3D printers for the manufacturing of jibs, fixtures and tooling. 

By bringing carbon fiber to the F123 Series printers, via FDM ABS-CF10 material, Stratasys will bring the material to more end users of the F170, F270 and F370 3D printers.

ABS is an acronym for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, a popular thermoplastic for 3D printing. ABS is known for being sturdy, able to handle high heat and resist wear at a low costs.

According to Stratasys, carbon fiber material is an alternative to metal parts. FDM ABS-CF10 includes 10% chopped carbon fiber, has 15% more strength than standard ABS and is lighter than metal. Stratasys estimates that the additive manufacturing market for polymer jibs and fixtures is expected to be almost a $600 million market by 2023\. 

The material will be available April 2021.

Material innovations are among the ways that additive manufacturing will scale.
