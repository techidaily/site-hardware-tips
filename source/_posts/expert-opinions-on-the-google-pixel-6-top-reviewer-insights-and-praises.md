 Whenever Google releases a new smartphone, we all have to stand up and take notice. The company recently [announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/unblocking-windows-upgrade-error-xc004f050-code/), and now the reviews for the phones have started pouring in. As it turns out, Google made a fantastic phone.

##  Why Does Everyone Love the Pixel 6?

 The smartphone critics worldwide have had some time to play with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, and the reviews are almost unanimously positive.

 Over at [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-6-review-i-cant-think-of-a-better-phone-to-recommend/), reviewer Patrick Holland spent over a week playing with the Pixel 6 and offered some incredible praise. "For the price, this is the best phone you can buy," the review said. As for the score, Cnet gave the phone an extremely solid 8.8/10, which is nothing short of impressive. It's not a perfect phone due to sometimes [frustrating under-display fingerprint reader](https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-expert-strategies-for-keeping-tiktok-videos-available/) and ultrawide camera lacking, but the pros seem to far outweigh the cons based on the overall review and score.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/personaltech/google-pixel-6-review.html) also published an extremely in-depth review that's worth a read. Reviewer Brian X. Chen seemed mostly happy with the phone, but his review wasn't as glowing as some others. Still, he rounded out the review by saying, "In the end, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro are solid products. Considering their starting prices, which are about $200 lower than competing high-end phones from Samsung and Apple, I can recommend them to Android fans."

 The title of [Gizmodo's](https://gizmodo.com/the-pixel-6-is-so-good-why-buy-anything-else-1847927331) review really hammers home just how much reviewer Sam Rutherford loved the phone. The title reads, "The Pixel 6 Is So Good, Why Buy Anything Else?". Again, it's not a perfect phone, and the review cites some issues with the base model, such as lacking support for mmWave 5G, but this issue can be alleviated by going with the high-end models. Rutherford brought the quality of the phone home by saying, "If all you care about is getting the best phone for your money, the Pixel 6 is it."

[Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html) loved the phones, giving them an incredible 91/100\. Reviewer Cherlynn Low mentioned some "minor flaws" but called them "excellent phones for the price." According to the review, the biggest drawback is the show fingerprint scanner, which seems to be an issue popping up in quite a few reviews. Still, if that's the worst thing you can say about a phone, it must be pretty good.

 How about [Wired](https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/)? Reviewer Julian Chokkattu gave the phone a really high 9/10, saying that it has "Great performance. Fantastic cameras for photos and video." The review did bring up the ill-fated fingerprint scanner, but based on the 9/10 score, it doesn't seem like a deal-breaker. Chokkattu really talked up the voice typing feature on the Pixel 6, making it sound like a true game-changer.

##  Want to Get a Pixel 6?

 I really looked hard to find a negative review from a major publication to balance out the positivity, but the fact is, everyone seems to like this phone. If you want to get either a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, you can order them from just about anywhere that sells smartphones. The base Pixel 6 starts at a shockingly low $599, and the Pro comes with an $899 price tag.
