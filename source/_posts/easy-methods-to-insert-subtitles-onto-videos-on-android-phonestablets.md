##  Automatically Add Subtitles to a Video on Android

 If you don't want to spend too much time and effort finding and downloading the subtitles—you can add them automatically. All you need is an [internet connection](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/sourav-joshis-strategy-for-youtube-earning-in-the-year-2024/) and a subtitle app that can search and download subtitles for your videos.

 Adding subtitles automatically will smooth the process, and you don't have to rely on a manual search to download the subtitles. It also automatically synchronizes the subtitles with the video sound. The media player apps adjust the timing and speed of the subtitles according to the video playback.

 You can try VLC and MX media player—that will do the most work for you.

###  Add Subtitle to a Video Using VLC Media Player

 The [VLC](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000410/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en&gl=US) ranks among the top media players for Android devices. You can play almost any [local and network video using VLC](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/economic-hearing-enhancement-with-senso-wireless-buds/). It supports [multiple video formats](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-locked-apple-id-from-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/) such as [MKV](https://facebook.techidaily.com/trust-in-facebooks-secret-talks/), [MP4](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-techniques-for-youtube-video-production-with-sony-vegas/), [AVI](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-iphone-13-detailed-reviews-and-comparisons-with-rivals/), and [MOV](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-chart-topping-storytellers-to-follow-on-youtube-this-year/).

 You can use VLC to directly download and add subtitles to your favorite TV show or movie. You can also customize the subtitle text appearance and position from VLC settings. This will help you to adjust the subtitle synchronization with the video.

 Open the video in VLC Player to add subtitles to it. Tap anywhere on the screen, and you'll see some on-screen buttons. Find the subtitle icon, usually located in the bottom left corner. Tap on that subtitle icon to bring up the subtitle options.

![select subtitle option](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-15.png) 

 Click the little down arrow to expand the "Subtitles" menu. Here you will see different options for subtitle selection. To proceed with adding subtitles, select "Download Subtitles."

![Click the drop-down button and select Download subtitles](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-12.png)

###  Add Subtitles to a Video Using MX Player

[MX Player](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000410/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad&hl=en&gl=US) is another simple and convenient media player to add subtitles to your videos. Like VLC, it also supports direct download of subtitles from online databases.

 MX Player also has support for an extensive range of subtitle formats, such as SRT, SUB, SSA, ASS, and more. You can also load any subtitle file from your device. Inside the MX player settings, you can customize the subtitle appearance, and change the font size, color, style, and alignment.

 Open the MX player on your phone. Browse and play the video on which you want to add subtitles.

 Now, look up to the top right corner and spot the three horizontal dots. Tap on those dots.

![Selecting the MX player settings menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-16.png) 

 A menu will pop up. From there, choose the "Subtitle" option.

![MX Player search button for subtitles search](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-1-1.png) 

 By default, the MX player searches for English subtitles. You can also customize this for any other language. MX player searches for subtitles automatically based on the video name or metadata. You can also manually search by typing in the main keywords of your video title. It’s recommended to use the manual search option for better accuracy and relevance.

![specifying the text for subtitles in search menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-10.png) 

 MX Player will show you all the subtitles that are available for download. Simply check the box next to subtitles and hit the "Download" button.

![MX player show all subtitles for download](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-10.png)

##  Manually Add Subtitles to a Video on Android

 If you want more control over adding subtitles to your videos—you can add them manually. Sometimes, your media player might struggle to locate the specific subtitle file you need, and in such cases, manual addition is the way to go.

 To get started, you'll need to download the subtitle file from one of the many subtitle websites available. Subtitle files are typically available in formats like SRT, VTT, and SSA. You can download the subtitles in these supported formats. Once you've got them, you can use any [media player](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-archive-powerpoint-into-video-repository/) of your choice to seamlessly integrate them into your videos.

###  Using VLC Player

 To add subtitle files manually—play your video using the VLC media player. After that, select the option "Select Subtitle File" under subtitles settings.

![VLC player manual subtitle selection](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-17.png) 

 Next, browse and select the subtitle file from the file manager.

##  Subtitle vs. Captions: What’s the Difference

 Looking over your subtitle options and confused by some of them being called "captions?" For clarity, subtitles provide a translation of spoken dialogue in a video or film. They help viewers understand the content when it's in a language they don't speak. Subtitles usually appear at the bottom of your screen. They are often used for foreign-language films or shows.

[Captions](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-frp-from-htc-by-drfone-android/), on the other hand, go beyond just [translating dialogue](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/diablo-immortal-pc-release-cancelled-detailed-update/). They include not only spoken words but also sound effects, music cues, and other audio information. Captions are included in videos to ensure that content is accessible for people with hearing disabilities. Captions allow you to understand everything that's happening in the video—not just the dialogue.
