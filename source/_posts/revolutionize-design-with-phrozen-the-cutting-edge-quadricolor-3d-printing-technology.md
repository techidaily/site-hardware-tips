Phrozen is one of the best-known names in the 3D printing scene and is especially popular amongst fans of miniatures painting or gaming as these resin printers can enable you to print your own minis to paint - sometimes saving you a massive amount of money compared to buying similar models from miniature gaming giants like Warhammer. However, you do have to pay to get the schematics for the models (some are free) and fork out for the resin.

 One of the best upgrades of the Phrozen Sonic Mini 8K S over its previous iteration is the better support for open-source slice software compatibility. The Phrozen Sonic Mini 8K S supports Lychee, Chitubox, and Tango, which are among the most popular slicers used in creating your 3D models.

 This printer comes ready to go straight out of the box and requires minimal setup to be up and running, but do read all of the safety material included as resin printing does come with some hazards, such as the fumes from the resin itself, and skin irritation from cleaning products needed to clean the prints and models after use.
