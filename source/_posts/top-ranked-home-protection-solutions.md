##  What to Look for in a Security System

 Security systems can include a control panel, sensors, cameras, alarms, keypads/remote controls, sirens, professional monitoring service, and smart home integrations. Make sure to find systems with enough accessories for your needs or ones that let you customize the package.

 Look for easy setup options. You can either set it up yourself or hire a pro. Also, consider [professional monitoring](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-switching-onoff-comment-functionality-on-youtube/), where the company watches over your property 24/7 and can send first responders in an emergency (monthly or annual subscription required).

 Power or internet outages can take a security system offline, leaving you vulnerable. So, prioritize systems that offer battery and cellular backups (this might need a professional monitoring subscription).

 Security stickers, alarms, and sirens are known to deter criminals. Most security systems will come with signs or stickers to place in visible areas of your home and almost all will have a siren, but not all will have a panic button. Make sure to double-check what you're getting in your potential security system!

 Surveillance footage is constantly generated, whether you’re self-monitoring or using professional monitoring. So, be sure to check the manufacturer’s privacy and data protection policies.

 Watch out for contracts. Some security systems are contract-free, but others may have short, mid, or long-term contracts. Some might even charge you a moving fee if you relocate. Always go over the contract terms carefully.

 Finally, using a security system can sometimes reduce your homeowner’s insurance premiums by up to 20%. Check the fine print to see if this applies to your location or chosen security system.

 The [Ring Alarm Pro-8 Piece Security System](http://www.amazon.com/Ring-Alarm-Pro-8-piece-kit/dp/B08HSTJPM5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003967&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-security-systems%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is our top pick and one of the best DIY security systems available. It features an [eero Wi-Fi 6 router](http://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003967&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-security-systems%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the Alarm Pro Base Station, a keypad, four window/door contact sensors, a motion detector, and an alarm range extender. You can expand this by purchasing additional hardware and Wi-Fi coverage.

 One of the things we love most about this system is how easy it is to install. The box comes with a DIY installation kit, saving you potentially hundreds of dollars that you can use to expand your security system hardware. Once everything is set up, your footage can be stored in the cloud for up to 180 days, giving you plenty of time to watch, download, or share. Plus, all videos are [end-to-end encrypted](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tech-gurus-rate-them-all-unveiling-apeaksofts-screen-recording-capabilities/) for your peace of mind.

 With the Ring Protect Pro plan, you’ll get professional monitoring from a dedicated Ring team 24/7\. If there's a break-in, fire, carbon monoxide leak, or other security threat, you’ll be immediately alerted and can request dispatch of first responders like the police, fire service, or an ambulance.

 The optional Ring Protect Pro plan costs [$20 a month or $200](http://ring.com/protect-pro) a year and includes additional benefits like 3GB of free data monthly and Alarm Cellular Backup, which keeps your system online during internet outages. The alarm is loud enough to reach up to 104dB, deterring criminals and alerting your neighbors. It’s compatible with Alexa and is contract-free.

 Like the Ring Alarm Pro 8-Piece Security System, the SimpliSafe 8-Piece Wireless Security System is super easy to install. There's no need for drilling or wiring. Just plug in the base station, download the [SimpliSafe app](http://support.simplisafe.com/articles/app-support/where-to-download-the-simplisafe-app/63447861013ba90af0bce6a2), place your sensors, and you're all set.

It costs about 66 cents daily, with no contracts or hidden fees.

 The SimpliSafe Base Station has a long-lasting battery and offers cellular backup to keep you connected, even during power or internet outages. Its panic button triggers a 95dB alarm and quickly sends police to your location, or you can use Secret Alerts to notify the police discreetly. The SimpliSafe security system works with Alexa and Google Assistant.

The starter kit includes the Vivint Smart Hub Control Panel, four door/window sensors, and a motion sensor. Vivint's hardware is top-notch, some of the best quality on the market.

 On the bright side, the Vivint technician will show you how to use the system. Plus, each package includes professional monitoring with Vivint specialists who monitor your property 24/7 and respond to alarms. They’ll also help out if you need assistance. If they can’t reach you during an emergency, Vivint will contact first responders on your behalf.

## FAQ

### Do home security systems deter crime?

 Yes, home security systems can help to deter crime and criminals. However, nothing is foolproof. You can combine security stickers, alarms, cameras, and guard dogs to improve security.

### Do all security systems integrate with my smart home?

 While most security systems will integrate with your smart home, some can integrate more than others. For instance, the Ring Alarm Pro 8-Piece Security System only integrates with Alexa, whereas the Abode 9-Piece Security System works with Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple HomeKit, IFTTT, and Z-Wave/Zigbee.

### Do I need a permit to set up a home security system?

 It depends. [Some areas](https://www.security.org/home-security-systems/permit/) require a permit for security systems with an alarm. Additional permits may be needed if your system includes smoke detection, if you are rewiring your home, or performing construction during the installation process. Board approval may also be required if you're part of an HOA. Some providers can help you apply for necessary permits as part of their professional monitoring package.
