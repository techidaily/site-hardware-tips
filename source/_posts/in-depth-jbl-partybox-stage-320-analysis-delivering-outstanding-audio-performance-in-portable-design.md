##  Do You Need the PartyBox to Have a Party?

 There are Bluetooth speakers and then there are Bluetooth speakers. The Stage 320 falls into the latter category, which includes a growing number of big, beefy speakers aimed at being loud enough to host big events.

 Its primary qualification for being invited to a party is its sheer size and volume of output. It’s over two feet tall and weighs around 35 pounds. That’s why it has wheels built into its base. I had no problem rolling it around and then lifting it into the trunk of my SUV. I wouldn’t attempt to carry it much more than that, however.

 The Stage 320 has an output power of 240W, using two 6.5-inch woofers and two 25mm dome tweeters. Simply put, the speaker gets loud. Even before I could get to a 50% volume level, the speaker was filling my entire backyard with music.

 I feel confident in saying that the PartyBox Stage 320 could cover any house party. As long as a single speaker will do, it should be able to do it. If you do need multiple speakers or want to run a stereo setup, then the Stage 320 can do that too—wirelessly syncing to another JBL PartyBox speaker. (Although I didn’t get a chance to test that configuration with this product.)

 Beyond being defined by their size and volume output, party speakers are largely defined by their flashing lights. The Stage 320 has three different lighting areas that can dance to the beat of the music. It’s cool to see the lights, but I’m more bullish on a speaker’s inputs.

 In the case of this JBL speaker, it features two quarter-inch inputs that can be used for wired microphones or guitars. The inputs can also be used with wireless mics that have compatible adapters. I was able to test the [JBL PartyBox Wireless Mic](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003088/https://www.jbl.com/partybox-speakers/PARTYBOX-WIRELESS-MIC.html) which comes with a wireless adapter and two microphones. (The mics synced instantly with the push of a button and I never experienced any wireless interference. They were dead simple to use and had excellent fidelity. I loved using them.)

 I found it interesting that the speaker had a removable battery. In fact, on the first pass of the speaker, I even pulled it out and cut the power because I didn't realize it was the battery. The battery pack with up to 18 hours of life is quite tiny compared to the speaker's physical dimensions. I doubt I would be tempted to buy or carry a second battery, but I like the idea of being able to do that.

##  A Karaoke Machine For Those Who Love to Sing

 The beauty of using the Stage 320 for karaoke is that it has microphone knobs right on top. It’s easy to dial up the echo (reverb) or to adjust the volume, bass, or treble.

 I found it a little tricky to turn the knocks to a specific level, however. If someone walked over and twisted the knobs, it would take a minute or two to readjust the controls to exactly how you had them. That nuance aside, the knobs were easy to turn and worked well.

 Although I felt embarrassed belting out some songs on the speaker, it did its job perfectly. The music was booming while my vocals were painfully clear. Performing karaoke in a big venue is a legitimate use of the Stage 320 speaker.

 But it’s not just singing. This is a perfectly viable option for a small business to use as a PA system or for a business that has occasional performers. This would be great for a solo artist with a guitar and microphone—hence the “Stage” name.

 Also on the top of the unit are sound effect buttons. So if you’re into some gimmicky effects then the Stage 320 has you covered. Not only can you activate a handful of cheers and record scratches from inside the app, but you can also program these three physical buttons on the speaker for access to sounds without using a phone.

 My kids really liked pressing these buttons, but I couldn’t imagine using them in a real party setting. Maybe the airhorn sound could come in handy if the speaker is being used at a picnic or event with outdoor games, but otherwise, I think most people will ignore them.

##  Should You Buy the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 Speaker?

 It feels a little obvious to say, but the [JBL PartyBox Stage 320](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-PartyBox-Stage-320-Telescopic/dp/B0CTD6V6S6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003088&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fjbl-partybox-stage-320-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a serious speaker. A fun one, but it’s still all business. If you’re not hosting events regularly or throwing raging karaoke parties, I would probably steer you to the Club 120 or the On-The-Go Essential, both of which come in under $400.

 I can think of a lot of small businesses, hobbyists, or other people who are beyond entry-level gear but who don’t really need professional gear and the Stage 320 is perfect for them. Overall, I’m bullish on the Stage 320\. It has a healthy amount of features with good access to physical controls. But importantly, it just rocked. It’s loud and powerful but still sounded crisp and clear. It could be a workhorse for you.
