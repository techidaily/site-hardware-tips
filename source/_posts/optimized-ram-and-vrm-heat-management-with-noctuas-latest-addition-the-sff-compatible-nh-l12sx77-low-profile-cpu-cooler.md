## Discover Exceptional Cooling Value: The Thermalight Phantom Spirit 120 SE, Now Available at an Unbeatable Price of Just $35

Having[reviewed the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermalright-phantom-spirit-120-review) it's safe to say that this is one of our favorite air coolers thanks to the mix of performance and astounding value compared to the competition in the same price range. We gave the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE maximum stars and an Editor's Choice award for these reasons, but, best of all, this fantastic air cooler has dropped in price - increasing its bang-for-buck value.

 At Newegg, the[Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE has dropped to $35](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-4890527282452983055%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fthermalright-phantom-spirit-120-se-argb%252Fp%252F13C-000Y-000F0) from an original $40 price. It does also seem to be the[same price over at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FThermalright-Phantom-Spirit-Cooler-Heatpipes%2Fdp%2FB0BR3JQTSN%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-1587143952436572547-20) currently, but unfortunately, I'm unable to see the price history thanks to a small glitch my my price tracker. Regardless, this is a fantastic choice for an air cooler for your CPU, wherever you choose to pick one up.

 Compatible with both Intel LGA: 1700/1150/1151/1155/1156/1200, and AMD: AM4/AM5 sockets, the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE is a chunky CPU cooler thanks to its twin tower and fan design, but it's no bigger than other coolers of this type. The CPU cooler's dimensions are 125mm (L) x 110mm (W) x 154mm (H), so always check this against your current setup to make sure it fits in your case and configuration.
