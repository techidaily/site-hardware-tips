 Most keyboard apps have subtle vibration—also known as "haptic feedback"—to help make typing on a touchscreen feel more tactile. If you'd rather not feel your Android phone buzz with every tap, this can be turned off.

 As with many things in the Android world, there are [many different keyboard options](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-construct-humor-memes-via-adobe/) at your disposal. We'll be showing you how to turn off the vibration for two of the most common keyboard apps—-Google's Gboard and the default Samsung Galaxy Keyboard.

##  Turn Off Keyboard Vibration for Gboard

 Gboard is available for all Android phones and tablets—it may already be the default keyboard on your device. If it's not, you can [install it from the Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207717/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) and [set it as the default keyboard](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-construct-humor-memes-via-adobe/).

 First, enter a text box to bring up the Gboard keyboard. From there, press the gear icon to open the app's Settings.

 That's all there is to it! You won't feel anything when you type with Gboard anymore.

 On a Samsung Galaxy device with the default keyboard enabled, enter a text box to bring up the keyboard. Press the gear icon to open the keyboard settings.

 You're all set! Your keyboard will no longer vibrate with every keypress. This is one of the great things about software keyboards. You get [a lot more customization options](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-locked-apple-id-from-apple-iphone-11-pro-by-drfone-ios/) than you would with a physical keyboard. Make sure it's exactly how you want it to be.
