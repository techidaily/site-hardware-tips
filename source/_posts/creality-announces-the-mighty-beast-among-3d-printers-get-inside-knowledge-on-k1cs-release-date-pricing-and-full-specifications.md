## 'Thrifty Beginners' Ultimate Black Friday Deal - Score a 4K Resin 3D Printer for Just 56% of the Original Price

Getting started with resin 3D printing is a little more difficult and sometimes expensive than FDM printers such as the[Elegoo Neptune 3 Plus](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/print-big-with-this-black-friday-elegoo-neptune-3-plus-deal) . You need a printer and a[wash and cure station](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/black-friday-elegoo-was-and-cure-resin-3d-printing-) to process your prints. If you can save a little money, then the overall cost isn't too different to FDM, but resin has a much higher level of detail.

[We reviewed the Anycubic Photo Mono 2](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/anycubic-photon-mono-2) and loved the detailed 4K prints, fast setup and effortless print removal. This is a cost reduced resin printer. The build quality is good, but the materials are plastic rather than metal or acrylic. The menu and controls are simplified but they get the job done.

 The build volume of 165 x 89 x 143mm is 20% larger than the photon Mono 4K. This is on the smaller size of resin printers, but our reviewer was able to fit 6 presupported miniatures on the build plate at once.
