##  A Perfectly Minimal Travel Battery

 On its surface, there’s not much to the BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K. It’s flashy in its lime-green color, but it’s just a battery. It can provide up to 16 hours of additional power with its 5,000mAh internal battery. When out and about, it can recharge an iPhone at 7.5W, but when plugged in, it can provide the full 15W Qi2 speed.

 That means it can power your phone at a decent speed on the train, but when back at the hotel and plugged in, it can power it even faster at MagSafe’s top pace. It would be nice to have something faster than 7.5W while on the go, but really, anything above 5W is a win. The Qi2 spec means the power bank can have a life beyond iPhones too, when Android phones get around to adding the feature.

 Beyond the Qi2 differentiator, the other thing that makes it incredibly useful is the flip-out kickstand. Typically I’m watching a baseball game or some other video when my iPhone could use a boost of power. This solves the problem of keeping the phone propped up without adding any bulk. It’s useful enough just as a stand that it's not dead weight even after its power is gone.

 Importantly, The BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K is lightweight enough not to be noticeable in my bag. I don’t have to decide how important the emergency power supply is for my trip. It’s not going to weigh me down. It is heavier than the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack, but only by an ounce.

 While not critical to the experience of using the Belkin battery, I do like the colors that it comes in. The lime color pops in person and the blue looks fresh. I’m a fan. I also like how Belkin includes a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box. A nicety that’s no longer guaranteed.

 The USB-C cable not only serves as a way to recharge the Power Bank 5K when it's depleted, but it can charge other non-Qi devices too. The BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K isn’t only my phone’s backup battery, but it also recharges my X100VI camera, earbuds, Bluetooth speaker, iPad, and other things that get drained while traveling.

 I’ve also tried Belkin’s bigger Qi2 [BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 10K + Cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRE52ZM/A/belkin-boostcharge-pro-magnetic-charging-power-bank-10k-cable) which has twice the battery, faster on-the-go charging, and a built-in USB-C cable. It’s fantastic if you need even longer battery life. I always opt for the smaller and lighter option though, so the 5K version is the one in my travel bag.

##  Should You Buy the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K?

 There are a lot of phone batteries out there but the reason the [BoostCharge Pro Power Bank 5K](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRGJ2ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2-pro-magnetic-power-bank-5k-magsafe-compatible) has found a place in my small pouch of cables is because it melds a few key features together. It’s thin, lightweight, powerful, and has a handy kickstand.

 I tend to prioritize minimal efficiency over any kind of overly complex solution. Even though the battery’s price is premium, within a reasonable range, I just love what it offers.
