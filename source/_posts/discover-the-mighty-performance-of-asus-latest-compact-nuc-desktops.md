## Discover the Mighty Performance of ASUS' Latest Compact NUC Desktops

Since ASUS took over from making NUCs from Intel, the company has put out several models, with some of them having high-end hardware. It's a boon for tiny PC enthusiasts, and they're among the best ones you can get in that particular market segment. Now, ASUS has launched a couple of new models, and they're also worth checking out.

 ASUS has officially released the NUC 14 Pro and NUC 14 Pro+, the latest additions to the company's vast line of [tiny PCs](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-essential-open-worlds-you-cant-ignore-for-2024/). These compact powerhouses boast impressive specs and features, while still managing to be small enough to go low-profile on any desktop or even go behind your monitor.

 The [NUC 14 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU2004018%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fareyouahuman%253Freferer%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.newegg.com%25252Fasus-rnuc14rvku50000ui-nuc-14-pro%25252Fp%25252FN82E16856110265%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fasus-rnuc14rvku50000ui-nuc-14-pro%252Fp%252FN82E16856110265) comes in two models: the slim model, priced at $395 for a barebones version, and a "tall" version with added 2.5-inch hard drive support for just $5 more. The NUC 14 Pro supports up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, 96GB of RAM, and three storage devices. Even the base model features an Intel Core 3 100U processor and supports WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.

 For those seeking even more power, the [NUC 14 Pro+](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU2004018%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fareyouahuman%253Freferer%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.newegg.com%25252Fasus-rnuc14rvsu90000ui%25252Fp%25252FN82E16856110286%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fasus-rnuc14rvsu90000ui%252Fp%252FN82E16856110286) is the top-of-the-line option, starting at $869\. This model is currently available only with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor, but future models may offer Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 options. The NUC 14 Pro+ features enhanced cooling, an aluminum chassis, and a sleek design.

 Both mini PCs come with a variety of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, USB Type-C and Type-A, and 2.5 GbE Ethernet. These two computers join ASUS' giant line of tiny PCs, and they're probably among the most powerful ones you can get at the moment.

 The NUC 14 Pro and NUC 14 Pro+ are now available to purchase on Newegg, and they might show up at other retailers soon.
