## Expert Hardware Analysis by Tom – Dive Into Gear Details

Create and 3D print QR codes easily. You can convert it into a 3D model and 3D print it. You can create physical objects embedded with the QR code, like keychains, business card holders, Wi-Fi passwords, and even embed them on photo frames, which when scanned, redirect to a personal video. The ideas are endless.

 3D-printed QR codes can withstand environmental factors that might damage traditional printed codes, which makes them helpful even for outdoor use. All you need is a reliable FDM 3D printer. Check out our[best 3D printers](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-3d-printers) for recommendations if you don't already own one. We will take you through the process of generating the QR code, embedding it into a 3D model, and preparing it for 3D printing. You will also show you how to convert a QR code in 2D image into a 3D model.

### Generating the QR Code

## Generating the QR Code

 You can use various tools to generate the QR codes; we will use the[qrcode2stl](https://printer.tools/qrcode2stl/) in this article. After clicking the link, you can follow the steps below:

 1.**Select the QR code options** : text/URL, Wifi, E-mail, Contact, or SMS. For our case, we shall choose Text/URL and then**enter the website URL** .

 2.**Choose error correction** . When the value is higher, the QR code will be denser. In our case, we shall retain the medium value of 15%.

 3.**Specify 3D model settings** , that is, base options like the shape, width, corner radius, and border settings. You can also add custom text and attach a hole to the side of the tag, which you can attach to your keychain by selecting the**Keychain** box. Specify the QR Code settings like the depth, margin, block size, and Icon.

 4\. After applying the settings,**click** **Generate 3D Model,** and it will display in the right section, as shown below.

 6.**Download the STL file** by clicking**Save as STL** .

 7.**Import the STL file** to a[3D printer slicer](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/6-best-3d-printer-slicers-and-how-to-use-them) of your choice.

 If you are using a single-extruder 3D printer and you don’t want the process of painting the file after 3D printing, you will need to change the filament during the 3D printing process. To do this:

 1.**Locate the layer** when the color changes as you preview the slicing. In my case, it will be at layer 9.

 2.**Install the Modify G-Code extension** in Cura. You can find it on Extensions > Post Processing.

 3\. After installing, go to**Extensions > Post Processing** \>**Modify G-Code** and then proceed by clicking**Add a script** .

![3D Print QR codes](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQQs2srSXt5ysMNTsJ7u5k-320-80.png)

 5.**Re-slice the design** and send the G-code to your 3D printer.

 The 3D printer will pause when it reaches the layer that you have specified and it will move to the origin of the print bed so that you can swap the filament. In case you don’t have white and black filaments and you have a single extruder 3D printer, you can 3D print as it is.

![3D Print QR codes](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4xcS97zTMB8PBdc5dabbs3-320-80.png)

 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

 The next step will be to paint the QR code part to distinguish it from the rest of the sections so the camera can pick up the code. You can use a small brush or a black marker pen and must ensure that you do it precisely to avoid distorting the QR code.
