## Samsung Teases Artificial Intelligence Capabilities for Legacy Galaxy Devices

During the launch of the impressive new Galaxy S24 series, Samsung confirmed that older models would also get some exciting Galaxy AI features in the coming months. Now, we have a short list revealing which features could hit the Galaxy S23 and other phones and tablets.

 Spotted by Mishaal Rahman, it looks like only four Galaxy AI features will potentially trickle down to other devices. The official Samsung UK comparison page detailing all the features we loved in our [Galaxy S24 Ultra review](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-profit-strategies-for-vimeo-content-creators/) mentions which Galaxy AI features are "coming soon" for the Galaxy S23.

 According to Samsung, Google's new [Circle to Search](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) using Bard AI, Live Translate, Photo Assist, and Note Assist is coming to flagship devices from 2023\. That includes the Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy Z Fold and Flip 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9\. That's only four of the more than ten Galaxy AI features debuting on the Galaxy S24\. More importantly, it doesn't sound like any of those will be available for the Galaxy S22 Ultra, Z Fold 4, or older devices like the Galaxy S21 series. So, as long as you have one of Samsung's high-end models released in 2023, you'll get to enjoy a little bit of the magic.

 This isn't good news if you were hoping to get generative AI photo edits, photo ambient wallpapers, or transcript assist without upgrading to the latest and greatest. It's also worth noting that Samsung's fancy Galaxy AI features [won't be free forever](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-stream-efficiency-obs-meets-zoom/), and some of its best AI-powered tools could cost money starting in 2025.

 Circle to Search is a Google feature in partnership with Samsung, so there's a chance it'll eventually be available on devices other than the Galaxy S23, S24, and Pixel devices, but we'll have to wait and see.

 That this is the initial list posted on Samsung's product comparison page, which is always subject to change. Some of the other Galaxy AI features could potentially still come to the Galaxy S23, or even older models, later down the road. In closing, we still don't know when Samsung plans to release its AI goodies for more phones or how much those features might cost in 2025.
