## Experience Superior Clarity: Jabra's Latest Earbuds Feature Improved Acoustics & Active Noise Control

The general rule for wireless earbuds, and really most tech products, is that you'll get a better experience the more money you pay. Most people will be fine with a cheap pair of earbuds, but if audio quality and more niche features, you might want to spend more. If you're in the latter camp, make sure to check out these new Jabra earbuds.

 Jabra has just launched the [Elite 8 Active Gen 2](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003567/https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2) and [Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds](https://location-social.techidaily.com/top-7-skype-hacker-to-hack-any-skype-account-on-your-realme-note-50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), boasting several significant improvements over their predecessors. One notable addition is the world's first LE Audio smart case, allowing streaming from various devices directly to the earbuds. This innovation, according to Jabra, provides lower latency and superior audio quality compared to standard Bluetooth connections. The case also doubles as a versatile adapter for devices with USB-C or 3.5mm jacks, enabling spatial sound streaming in multiple scenarios. It's certainly cool, albeit a bit gimmicky.

 Both earbuds models feature improved spatial sound tuning and Dolby Atmos support. Call quality has also been upgraded with six-microphone technology and enhanced AI algorithms that prioritize voice clarity. Jabra's Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) has been fortified to block twice as much noise as previous generations, particularly in the mid- and low-frequency range. Adaptive ANC algorithms further optimize noise cancellation in different environments.

 The earbuds also offer enhanced situational awareness with new Natural HearThrough, effectively reducing wind noise and improving the clarity of ambient sounds. The Elite 8 Active Gen 2, designed for active lifestyles, boasts an IP68 rating for water and sweat resistance, as well as Jabra ShakeGrip technology for a secure fit. The Elite 10 Gen 2, focused on comfort, features a semi-open design, powerful 10mm speakers, and an IP57 rating.

 Both models will be available in mid-June 2024, with prices starting at $229 for the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 and $279 for the Elite 10 Gen 2\. They're looking really good, but the market for premium earbuds is also very saturated, so we'll have to see how well these stand out. They will become available for purchase over the coming weeks.
