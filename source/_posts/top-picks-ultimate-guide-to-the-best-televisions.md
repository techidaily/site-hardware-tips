## Top Picks: Ultimate Guide to the Best Televisions

Whether you are a movie buff looking for a cinematic experience, a gamer demanding responsive gameplay, or someone needing a TV for general entertainment, there is a wide array of excellent TVs on the market.

##  What to Look For in a TV in 2024

 A TV purchase can be tricky given that there are many things to consider, from the TV display technology to its feature set. But you can make TV shopping easier by being aware of a few crucial details.

 Display technology is one of the first things to consider when picking a new TV because it directly impacts the picture quality. Modern TVs use LED-backlit LCD or [OLED screens](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/). LED TVs are budget-friendly but have limitations in contrast and viewing angles. OLED offers superior picture quality but comes at a premium. High-end LED TVs with advancements like QLED and mini-LED bridge the performance gap, but often at OLED price points.

 Beyond screen type, the [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/), [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/), and image processing also affect a TV's visual performance. Ideally, you want high peak brightness, a wide color gamut, and sound picture processing.

 It's equally important to ensure your TV has all the features you need, whether you want [Dolby Vision HDR](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) support or a high refresh rate for smooth gaming. Fortunately, most TVs cover the essential features, and only the advanced features vary from model to model.

 Finally, factor in your budget and screen size. There are TVs for every budget, with value brands like Hisense, TCL, and Roku offering excellent options without breaking the bank. High-end features naturally come at a premium. Choose a screen size that complements your viewing distance. Larger screens are ideal for bigger rooms or those who sit farther away, while smaller screens work well for cozy spaces or near-field viewing.

##  Best TV Overall: [LG G4](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55G4SUB/dp/B0CVS2TCWR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

| Pros                                                | Cons      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Fantastic picture quality with high peak brightness | Expensive |
| Includes all advanced gaming features               |           |
| Sleek design and outstanding build quality          |           |

 There is no dearth of excellent televisions in 2024, but LG’s flagship 4K OLED TV—[the G4](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55G4SUB/dp/B0CVS2TCWR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)—stands out with its incredible picture quality, advanced gaming features, and beautiful design. It’s available in five sizes, so you can choose the perfect size for your setup.

 The LG TV looks sleek and is well-built. It can also sit flush with the wall thanks to the flat side profile. Depending on your size, you’ll get a tabletop stand or a slim wall mount. Either of the two is also available as a separate purchase.

 Like its predecessor, the G4 includes [Micro-Lens Array technology](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) to deliver high peak brightness, making it perfect for most ambient lighting conditions. Its incredible brightness also helps it offer a fantastic HDR performance. So whether you’re using Dolby Vision or regular [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) content, you’ll get an incredible experience.

 As mentioned, the LG OLED TV excels at gaming. It has a low input lag for responsive gaming and support for all major VRR formats to reduce [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/). It also has four full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports, each capable of handling 4K 144Hz gaming, the maximum supported by the display.

 One of these HDMI ports functions as an [eARC port](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) to pass through high-definition audio to your connected soundbar or AV receiver. Both [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) and [DTS:X](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ace-windows-10-tricks-to-save-time-and-energy/) are supported.

 While there is plenty of 4K content to watch, the G4 has excellent [upscaling](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/) to prepare low-resolution content for its beautiful display.

 The only real downside to the TV is its high price tag, but that’s to be expected for an OLED TV of such caliber. If it falls out of your budget, you can consider the [Hisense U8N](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-65U8N/dp/B0CY4TQ91Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), a fantastic value for money. It’s a QLED TV that performs admirably and is unlikely to disappoint you. However, if you want to stick with an OLED, [LG’s C4](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55C4PUA/dp/B0CVRDK4P6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a good alternative.

![A Hisense U6N in a room on top of a TV stand.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hisense-u6n.jpg) 

Hisense

| Pros                                                                       | Cons                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Excellent picture quality thanks to quantum dots and mini-LED backlighting | Limited to 60Hz refresh rate |
| Dolby Vision HDR support                                                   |                              |
| Value for money                                                            |                              |

 Looking for a feature-rich 4K TV without breaking the bank? [Hisense's U6N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4X5M8D/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) delivers exceptional value for money. Part of Hisense's ULED line, it boasts vivid and lifelike colors thanks to [quantum dots](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-x6-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/) and impressive contrast with [mini-LED backlighting](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). While its brightness may not match the absolute best TVs, the U6N punches well above its weight class in overall picture quality.

 The U6N packs all the latest must-have features. It supports Dolby Vision HDR for the best experience in compatible content and [Filmmaker Mode](https://article-files.techidaily.com/inverting-image-hues-in-photoshop/) for viewing movies and shows exactly as the creators envisioned. Google TV provides a user-friendly interface with a vast app library, including all major streaming services, Google Assistant, and [Chromecast functionality](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-dji-x20-drone-vision-wear-review/).

 It's also suitable for casual gaming because of its low input lag and fast response time, which ensures a smooth and responsive experience. While the TV supports VRR technologies, its 60Hz refresh rate won't satisfy enthusiasts seeking high frame-rate gaming. For those priorities, consider [Hisense's U7N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY56XCJ9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which offers a higher refresh rate but comes at a slightly higher price point, remaining quite affordable nonetheless.

 The U6N is available in various sizes, ranging from [55 inches](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4X5M8D/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to a whopping [85 inches](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4P8QRL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), allowing you to choose the ideal display for your space.

##  Best Gaming TV: [Samsung S90D](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CV9L3R7V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![samsung s90d OLED TV](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/samsung-s90d.jpg) 

Samsung

| Pros                                | Cons                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Packs all advanced gaming features  | Lacks Dolby Vision support |
| 144Hz refresh rate with VRR support |                            |
| Impressive picture quality          |                            |

 While the LG G4, our best overall pick, is amazing for gaming, the [Samsung S90D](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CV9L3R7V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a compelling alternative for serious gamers seeking exceptional performance. This 4K OLED TV boasts a 144Hz refresh rate panel, supporting all major VRR technologies and [Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/) for tear-free gameplay. An incredibly low input lag and near-instantaneous response time further solidify the S90D as a top-notch gaming TV. More importantly, its four HDMI 2.1 ports can handle 4K gaming at a buttery-smooth 144Hz refresh rate. So you'll have trouble connecting multiple consoles and PCs.

 The S90D's impressive capabilities extend beyond gaming. Thanks to its OLED panel, it delivers stunning picture quality for movies, TV shows, and all your entertainment. High peak brightness and a near-infinite contrast ratio produce vibrant visuals with deep blacks and lifelike colors. The S90D also supports HDR10 and [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/). However, Dolby Vision is absent.

 Like other Samsung TVs, the S90D utilizes a Tizen-based smart TV platform featuring the company's Gaming Hub. This hub provides access to a vast array of cloud gaming services, including popular options like [Amazon Luna](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-av1-versus-vp9-the-ultimate-codec-showdown/), [NVIDIA GeForce Now](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/smileshop-memelore-hub/), and [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-cinematic-illumination-a-filmmakers-path-to-stunning-colors/).

 The S90D comes in a wide range of sizes, from a compact [42-inch model](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CWVLTGMN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to a cinematic [83-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CVSGQ71N/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) behemoth. It's important to note that only the [55-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CV9L3R7V/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CV9VGMPT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [77-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CVS38Q4M/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models utilize the [QD-OLED panels](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/), while the remaining sizes incorporate WOLED technology. Both offer the core benefits of OLED technology but with slight variations in panel structure and color filtering.

 The S90D complements its impressive performance with a premium design and excellent build quality, making it a stylish addition to any entertainment space.

 Unfortunately, like other OLED TVs, the S90D is expensive. You can alternatively consider the [Hisense U8N](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-65U8N/dp/B0CY4TQ91Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) as a slightly more affordable option. However, you'll get an LED panel with quantum dots and mini-LED backlighting instead of OLED.

![sony a95l](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sony-a95l.jpg) 

Sony

| Pros                                           | Cons                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fantastic picture quality and image processing | Only two HDMI 2.1 ports                   |
| Dolby Vision, Atmos, and DTS:X support         | Minor bugs in Dolby Vision implementation |
| Superb upscaling                               | Expensive                                 |

 Although other TV manufacturers are catching up, Sony continues to outshine its competition by offering better image processing, making its TVs generally superior for watching movies and TV shows. Thanks to its vibrant QD-OLED 4K panel, Dolby Vision HDR support, and impressive color accuracy, the company’s [A95L](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYPT328K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is our pick for the best TV for movies.

 The Sony offering gets plenty bright and has a wide color gamut with complete coverage of the DCI-P3 color space to deliver a fantastic HDR performance. So, whether you're watching the latest Netflix original or a Blu-ray with Dolby Vision support, you’ll get an excellent experience.

 The TV also supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround sound formats for immersive audio, which you can pass to your soundbar or AV receiver via the eARC port. Additionally, you can use the TV speaker as a central channel in your sound system.

 Moreover, the A95L shines at upscaling lower-resolution content, ensuring your DVD collection looks great on its beautiful 4K screen.

 Google TV handles the software duties, giving you access to almost every streaming service. The TV also supports ATSC 3.0 for access to high-resolution over-the-air broadcast channels.

 Finally, the Sony offering boasts a stunning design and exceptional build quality, making it a worthy centerpiece for any home theater. You can choose from [55-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYPT328K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYPYRH4F/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or [75-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYPMMLTR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models to fit your viewing space.

 Unfortunately, the TV has only two HDMI 2.1 ports. It also has [minor issues in its Dolby Vision implementation](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/sony/a95l-oled#test%5F13903), which lead to brighter-than-expected shadow details and a pink or green tint in some content.

#####  Sony A95L

If you prioritize picture quality and an immersive home theater experience, the Sony A95L stands out as a clear champion.

##  Best 8K TV: [Samsung QN900D](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Infinity-Enhancer-QN65QN900D/dp/B0CV9JN36R/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![A Samsung QN900D in a room sitting on a TV stand.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/samsung-qn900d-01.jpg) 

Samsung

| Pros                                             | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Outstanding picture quality                      | Expensive               |
| Excellent upscaling for lower-resolution content | No Dolby Vision support |
| Advanced gaming features                         |                         |

 While many other TV manufacturers have moved away from [8K TVs](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-ways-to-manage-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/), Samsung is fully committed and releases two new models annually. Its 2024 8K flagship, the [QN900D](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Infinity-Enhancer-QN65QN900D/dp/B0CV9JN36R/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), is your best bet for an 8K TV. It packs several improvements on the picture quality and upscaling fronts over its predecessor, the [QN900C](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN75QN900C/dp/B0BTMKGBGJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), our previous pick for this category.

 The QN900D is among the best-performing mini-LED TVs. It delivers stunning visuals with lifelike colors, incredible peak brightness, and deep, inky blacks. HDR content shines on the QN900D thanks to its high brightness capabilities. While it doesn't support Dolby Vision HDR like some competitors, it offers excellent playback for HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG content.

 The QN900D is also an amazing TV for gaming, thanks to its low input lag, fast response time, and advanced gaming technologies. While the display has a native refresh rate of 120Hz, the TV can boost it to 240Hz with 4K resolution to offer even smoother gameplay. Moreover, you get access to the company's Game Bar and Gaming Hub features.

 Tizen OS is easy to use and has apps for popular streaming services. [Wi-Fi 6E](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-top-20-gags-and-laughter-on-youtube-for-downtime-delight/) support for superfast connectivity is also available, provided you have a compatible router.

 Another highlight of the Samsung QN900D is its design. The TV has barely any bezels and a flat profile. It can be mounted flush to the wall, creating a near-picture-frame look.

 As you can expect, the Samsung 8K TV is quite expensive, making it a sensible purchase only for folks with deep pockets or love for cutting-edge technology.

| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |

| Dolby Vision support                 |                            |

 Looking for a feature-rich 4K Roku TV? The [2024 Roku Pro Series QLED](https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Smart-TV-55-Inch-Backlit/dp/B0CVP6WK62/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid choice. It has several improvements over Roku's previous models, making it a much more well-rounded option.

 The Pro Series utilizes a VA-style LCD panel with a combination of mini-LED backlighting, quantum dots, and [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/). This translates to excellent picture quality with deep blacks, a fantastic contrast ratio, and impressive peak brightness. The Roku offering also supports all major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision and HDR10+, ensuring compatibility with your favorite HDR content. Aided by the TV's wide color gamut and high brightness, the HDR content pops on the screen.

 The Roku Pro Series is also a good choice for serious gamers as it packs all the advanced gaming features, including 4K 120Hz gaming support. There are two HDMI 2.1 ports to connect your gaming consoles or PCs, while full VRR support eliminates screen tearing for a seamless and responsive gaming experience. Low input lag further minimizes delays, keeping you in perfect sync with the on-screen action.

 While the TV excels in many areas, it's far from perfect. The VA panel has narrow viewing angles, meaning the picture will look washed out when viewed from the side. Additionally, its [upscaling performance](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/roku/pro-series-qled#test%5F112) leaves a lot to be desired.

 If viewing angles and picture quality are high priorities, the [Sharp AQUOS FS1 OLED Roku TV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CK577H6Z/?smid=AZY4IHDJBKC&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-tvs%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative, albeit at a slightly higher price point. This OLED TV boasts superior viewing angles and exceptional image quality due to its OLED technology. However, it also has poor image processing and is not widely available.

### Should I get a 4K TV?

 Even though you can find some HD and full-HD TVs on the market, it's best to spend on [a 4K TV](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/jaycut-for-beginners-learn-how-to-edit-videos-online-for-free/) in 2024\. 4K TVs deliver sharper images with finer details than lower-resolution TVs. If you're concerned about the price, 4K TVs are cheaper than ever, and you can easily find affordable models. 4K content is also widely available via all major streaming services, 4K Blu-rays, and ATSC 3.0 over-the-air broadcasts.

### What's the difference between LED, OLED, and QLED?

[LED, OLED, and QLED](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-best-android-unlock-software-for-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-device-top-5-picks-to-remove-android-locks-by-drfone-android/) refer to the display technology in a TV. LED TVs are essentially LCD TVs using an LED backlight. QLED TVs are also a type of LED TV, but they also use quantum dots to deliver a broader range of colors than a regular LED TV. OLED TVs are, however, based on a completely different display tech that uses self-emissive pixels instead of a backlight to create an image on your screen. As a result, OLED TVs have far better contrast and inky blacks, whereas LED TVs have to rely on other technologies like local dimming to improve their black levels and contrast. However, OLED TVs are more expensive than most LED and QLED TVs.

### Does the refresh rate matter for a TV?

 A TV's refresh rate plays an important part in the [TV's gaming capabilities](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/) to deliver a smooth gaming experience. Modern gaming consoles and PCs can output games at higher frame rates and you need a high refresh rate to make the most of it.

 Refresh rate can also come in handy while compensating for content mastered in different frame rates. For example, [a TV with a 120Hz refresh rate](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-vivo-y100i-power-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) can easily display 24p content by multiplying each frame five times. However, a 60Hz TV has to rely on additional steps to ensure you don't encounter judder.

### What is HDR?

[HDR, or high dynamic range](https://win-able.techidaily.com/defeating-pc-launch-obstacles-in-days-gone-a-step-by-step-troubleshooting-guide/), refers to a TV's capability to display a broader range of colors, brighter whites, and deeper blacks. SDR, or standard dynamic range, can only display a fraction of the total colors a human eye can comprehend. This fraction of colors expands significantly in an HDR TV, which results in much more lifelike color performance. There are various HDR formats that content creators use to master their content. Not all TVs support all HDR formats. So, it's vital to consider HDR compatibility while shopping to get the best out of the available HDR content.

### How do I clean my TV screen?

 You can [clean your TV screen](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-top-10-capture-cards-for-youtube-you-should-know/) with a dry, lint-free microfiber cloth. Turn off the TV and use the microfiber cloth to remove dust and fingerprints. You can also dampen a part of the microfiber cloth with distilled water to remove stubborn smudges. Always avoid chemical-based cleaners, paper towels, and other abrasive materials to avoid damaging the screen.

### Can I set up a TV outdoors?

 You can set up a TV outdoors, but you'll need to pick a weatherproof model that can withstand outdoor elements such as rain, dust, extreme temperatures, and snow. Additionally, outdoor-rated TVs have better reflection and glare handling as you'll have little to no ambient light control in an outdoor location. It's also a good idea to install an outdoor TV in a covered area to provide extra protection.
