 Having a portable power station is pretty essential these days. They make a great backup power source for our phones, smartwatches, and laptops. More importantly, a large power station can keep a router, fridge, and other appliances running during a power outage.

 I'm not talking about a little 10,000mAh power bank to charge your phone, but a shoebox-sized (or bigger) 1500W power station loaded with USB ports and plugs. I've owned power stations for years, and with how readily available the technology is, here's why everyone should have one.

##  What Is a Portable Power Station?

 As the name suggests, a power station is a device packed with tons of battery power ready to charge or run all your gear. Typically, they come in various sizes, from 500W to over 5,000W of power, enough to run a fridge, TV, laptop, CPAP, and more for countless hours, if not longer.

 For example, the small [Anker C800](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/turn-viewers-into-vendors-yielding-wealth-with-youtube-analytics-for-2024/) pictured above has a 768Wh battery inside. It can deliver over 1200 watts of power to various devices, surge to 1600W to start an appliance, or charge a smartphone and other accessories dozens of times. One device can do all of that. Sounds nice, right?

 A portable power station is essentially a device full of multiple smaller battery packs, similar to what's inside an electric vehicle. Most models have several 120V (2 and 3-prong) AC outlets, USB-C and USB-A ports, 12V DV ports, built-in lighting, and other features. Think of it as a silent and rechargeable battery generator.

##  More Power When You Really Need It

 While we always recommend [stocking up on little power banks](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), something bigger, like a power station, has far more to offer. Models come in various sizes and features and are an excellent way to recharge your gear off-the-grid, take camping, or use it around your home.

 Most manufacturers, including Anker, Bluetti, EcoFlow, Goal Zero, Jackery, and more, highlight these devices for camping. And honestly, that's one of the most convenient uses. If you like to go "glamping" with a blow-up mattress, heaters, and all sorts of LED lighting to set the vibe or take a Keurig coffee machine with you, one portable power station can run all those things for the weekend.

 Having additional power when you need it is a big deal, whether working on a job around the house, camping, Vanlife, or going off-grid. Being able to recharge my phone and stay in contact with friends and family is crucial. My [Anker 757 PowerStation](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-expert-recommendations-prime-apps-for-mac-video-recording-for-2024/) goes with me to my family cabin in Zion National Park, fishing trips, and more. The built-in LED light works wonders and has enough ports to simultaneously power or charge over ten devices.

 I've used power stations to recharge phones, drones, battery-powered lanterns, my [Velotric ebike](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-motorola-defy-2-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), speakers, and to make that all-important morning coffee.

##  Perfect For Emergencies

 Sure, charging phones and having fun during outdoor adventures is nice, but where a portable power station really shines is in an emergency. With all the summer storms happening lately, you'll absolutely want one when the power goes out.

 Living in Texas, I'm no stranger to power outages or severe weather. Last month, we had tornado warnings and crazy storms that knocked out the power overnight. A power station gives you peace of mind, so you'll be prepared if that happens.

 Luckily, I have an [Anker Solix F2000 (767)](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-infinix-hot-40-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/) that delivers over 2,400W of power for anything and everything. I used it to keep the fridge and freezer running in the morning, plug in some lights, and recharge all the phones in case the power remained out for an extended time. It did, so eventually, I unplugged the fridge and rolled my Anker into the garage to ensure the deep freezer stayed cold and our food didn't spoil.

#####  Anker 767 PowerHouse (2400W)

Get the powerful Anker 767 PowerHouse portable power station, which features more ports, 2,400W of power, Bluetooth connectivity, and more.

[Buy at Anker](https://www.anker.com/products/a1780) [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerHouse-767/dp/B09XM7WDZ2?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003565&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhy-everyone-should-have-a-portable-power-station%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

 I even plugged a smaller power station into our fiber internet router, staying powered up and connected to monitor the weather. Most models are stable enough to run a CPAP machine or other medical equipment, which can be lifesaving. See my point?

##  Renewable Power With Solar Charging

![anker solar panel charger charging a power station.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/anker-solar-charger-charging-battery.jpg) 

Cory Gunther / How-To Geek

 When the power station's battery runs out, you can quickly charge it from any wall outlet at home or use the cigarette lighter in a vehicle while traveling. Many of the [newer models can fully recharge](https://windows11.techidaily.com/breaking-through-qbittorrent-lag-a-windows-guide/) in under 60 minutes.

 A portable power station is also an excellent device for off-grid living or home emergencies because most [offer solar charging](https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-process-rewiring-audio-in-film-projects-for-2024/). It's not the fastest way to recharge the unit, but when the power is out for days on end, as long as there's any sunshine, you can slowly recharge it with solar panels. Then, you'll have more battery power ready for any situation.

##  Some Are Plenty Portable

![Anker PowerHouse 757 portable battery charging](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bd3605d1.jpg) 

Cory Gunther / How-To Geek

 Power stations are typically the size of a small cooler, although some are big enough to [run RVs and charge EVs](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-user-experience-with-timecodes-in-videos/). Most models under 2000W are small and light enough to easily carry upstairs, over by the fire, or go with you on outdoor adventures. However, if you need even more power, many models, like the [UGREEN PowerRoam](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphones-high-dynamic-range-step-by-step-guide/), come with wheels.

 As I said earlier, the [best power stations](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-downloading-and-installing-latest-xp-pen-drivers/) come in all different shapes, sizes, and power levels with various feature sets. You can grab a small one to recharge gadgets and phones, something a little bigger for power outages, or a model with a 30 or 50A RV plug for on-the-go.

 Many brands, like EcoFlow, offer entire home backup power solutions worth exploring. There's a portable power station for everyone, and with what these have to offer, I think most people should have one.
