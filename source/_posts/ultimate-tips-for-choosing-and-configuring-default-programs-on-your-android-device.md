## Ultimate Tips for Choosing and Configuring Default Programs on Your Android Device

When you have multiple apps that do the same thing, Android asks you which one you want to be the "default." This is one of Android's best features and you should take advantage of it. We'll show you how.

You can set a [default web browser](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discovering-the-finest-mac-screen-capture-software/), [search engine](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-realme-v30t-phone-frp-lock-by-drfone-android/), phone app, [messaging app](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/guide-to-activate-or-deactivate-network-discovery-feature-in-windows-11/), home screen launcher, and more.
