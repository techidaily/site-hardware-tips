[Our review of the latest flagship](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-split-mkv-videos-with-ease-top-10-free-software-options-for-2024/) said the smartphone "has excellent cameras, beautiful software with fast updates, a solid in-display fingerprint scanner, great performance for your daily tasks, the best Google experience, and a premium feeling build".
