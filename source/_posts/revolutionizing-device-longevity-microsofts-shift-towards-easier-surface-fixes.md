## Revolutionizing Device Longevity: Microsoft's Shift Towards Easier Surface Fixes

Microsoft is having its "Apple Silicon" moment with the new Surface Pro 11 and Laptop 7\. These devices use ultra-efficient ARM processors to achieve an extreme battery life with desktop-class performance. Critics are sure to compare ARM-based Surface devices and MacBooks for years to come, but one point is already clearer than day—Microsoft wins in repairability.

 The iFixit team is smitten with these new Surface products. In its new [teardown video](https://youtu.be/Eg7KXJQ0p00?si=KDx5jo1DWD4jNGVK), iFixit grants an 8/10 repairability score to both the Surface Pro 11 and Laptop 7\. While this isn't a perfect score, it's the highest-ever repairability score for a Surface device, and it's a mind-boggling improvement from the [2013 Surface Laptop's](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Laptop+Teardown/92915) "abysmal" score of 0/10\. Of course, the new Surface devices stand in stark contrast to Apple's [latest MacBooks](https://youtu.be/3yXCKMNEJUo?si=w2Xw0vuEb29CtoQC), which barely managed to eek a 3/10 on the repairability scale.

 As for _why_ the new Surface devices achieved such a high score—well, there's a lot going on here. The Surface Laptop 7 is shockingly easy to open, as its backplate is held down by just four screws and a set of magnets. Both the Laptop 7 and Pro 11 feature modular parts, easily-replaceable batteries (held down without adhesive), and relatively roomy interiors.

> "Overall, we were extremely pleased with Microsoft’s continued commitment to repairability. The Surface line of devices have performed such a stunning and swift U-turn from unrepairable to very repairable that we can’t help but be impressed, even if they don’t score a perfect 10/10."

 Microsoft also published repair guides for these Surface devices on launch day, which is extremely unusual. And you don't need to go through much trouble to find Microsoft's repair materials. Just scan the QR code that's printed inside either device, and it'll take you to the [appropriate repair manual](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100440). iFixit notes that you may not even need a repair manual, as most components within the Pro 11 and Laptop 7 feature a printed legend explaining the number (and type!) of screws that secure it to the chassis.

 Apple may have been the first to successfully build and sell ARM-based laptops, but it has failed to embrace user repairability. Instead, it engages in [malicious compliance](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-10-best-funny-videos-on-twitter/) and [doublespeak](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/empowering-android-with-the-advanced-ai-features-of-bing/) in an attempt to undermine right-to-repair initiatives. Microsoft's effort to increase device repairability is a refreshing sight and an appealing sales maneuver (although the [Recall fiasco](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ing-tips-select-the-top-5-url-shrinkers-for-youtube-for-2024/) overshadows many of the positives in this Surface release).

 I should note that this is just one step in a long journey. Microsoft began showing interest in repairability after spearheading an [e-waste sustainability report](https://www.asyousow.org/resolutions/2021/06/16-microsoft-sustainability-policies-for-electronic-waste) in 2021\. Within the span of a few months, the company assembled a "Design for Repair" team to collaborate with hardware engineers, and it even began selling official repair materials [through iFixit](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-lenovo-experience-through-effective-recording-for-2024/). In 2022, Microsoft published its first [official repair video](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/fixing-curved-video-gopros-fisheye-issue-for-2024/) for a Surface device, and its [Surface Pro 10](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-utilizing-skys-bounty-to-brighten-indoors/) claimed a reasonably high repairability score.
