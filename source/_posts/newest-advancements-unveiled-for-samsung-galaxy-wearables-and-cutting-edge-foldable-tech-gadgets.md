## Newest Advancements Unveiled for Samsung Galaxy Wearables and Cutting-Edge Foldable Tech Gadgets

Samsung is one of the best Android manufacturers as far as updates go right now. The company not only offers up to four major Android updates on its latest smartphones, but also strives to release them promptly most of the time. Case in point: it's currently testing [One UI 6](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-it-motorola-defy-2-wont-turn-on-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), based on the upcoming [Android 14](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-content-the-leading-online-television-recordings/), on a range of its flagship smartphones. If you're not ready to try beta software, though, you'll be glad to know Samsung has released a couple of (stable) updates for its folding smartphones and smartwatches.

 Samsung has officially released One UI 5.1.1 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and the Galaxy Z Flip 4, and users of these two foldable phones should expect to get the update sometime this month. The update should also follow sometime within the next few weeks for the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Z Flip 3, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip, although Samsung isn't really committing to releasing the update this month, so users of these phones will probably have to wait a bit longer. One UI 5.1.1 is the update that came with the newer [Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-compelling-mosaic-imagery/) and [Z Flip 5](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-tools-to-capture-your-pcs-display-on-windows-10-for-2024/), and as such, you should be getting many of the same software improvements these two newer foldables got. These include personalized panel management in Flex Mode as well as improvements to multitasking.

 In addition, Samsung is also officially releasing One UI 5 Watch for the Galaxy Watch 5 and the Galaxy Watch 4\. This update is based on the newer Wear OS 4 operating system, so this is actually a bit of a major change, and it's also the software that's running on the new [Galaxy Watch 6 series](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fix-guide-resolving-the-last-epoch-release-issues-on-pc-2024-edition/). Improvements in One UI 5 Watch include sleep management features such as Sleep Score Factors and Sleep Consistency readings, as well as fitness and health additions such as irregular heart rhythm notifications and the Personalized Heart Rate zone.

 If you want to check out the newest updates on your smartphone and smartwatch, keep an eye out for them over the course of the next few days.
