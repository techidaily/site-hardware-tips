## Explore the Fresh Release of Amazon'n Echo Spot - The Innovative Home Device!

Amazon's Alexa voice assistant is available on countless smart speakers, appliances, wearables, and other devices, but the company also still has its own Echo line of Alexa-powered products. Now there's a new Echo Spot, designed to function best as a bedside speaker.

 Amazon has launched the [all-new Echo Spot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004041&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Famazon-2024-echo-spot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), a customizable smart alarm clock with a compact, vibrant display that's powered by [Alexa](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-resource-compilation-for-media-imagery/). The very first Echo Spot was released in 2017, so as you might imagine, a lot has changed since then. The latest Echo Spot boasts improved visuals, enhanced audio quality, and better personalization options.

 The device's display can be tailored to match any bedroom aesthetic, offering six colorways and numerous clock faces. Instead of a fully round display, like the previous model, there's a smaller display which makes room for a front-firing speaker. The Echo Spot should be a servicable option for playing music, though it probably won't sound as great as full-sized smart speakers, like the regular [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004041&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Famazon-2024-echo-spot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or the [Google Nest Audio](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker-chalk%2F6428305.p%3FskuId%3D6428305).

 There's also physical microphone button and volume buttons, allowing you to turn off Alexa's always-listening mode when needed. In addition to this, the new model of the Echo Spot has no camera. It's probably one of the best ways to grab an Alexa device for your bedroom.

 Prime members can [buy the Echo Spot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004041&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Famazon-2024-echo-spot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) at a special price of $44.99 until July 17th, as part of Prime Day celebrations. It's never a good idea to buy Echo devices at full price, because they are almost always on sale, but this time Amazon is skipping that initial high pricing. For non-Prime members, the device is available for $79.99, or they can join Prime to take advantage of the discount. This will also be the regular price after the deal ends.
