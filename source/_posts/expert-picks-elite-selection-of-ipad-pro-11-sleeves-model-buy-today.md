##  What to Look For in an iPad Pro 11-Inch Case in 2024

 A high-quality case can protect your brand-new [iPad Pro 11-inch](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) from physical damage and improve its grip. It can also help personalize your iPad. So here are a few things to remember while shopping for an iPad Pro case.

 After sticking with the same design and dimensions for four generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro, Apple has finally made some tweaks for the 2024 version. This means you must buy a new case designed specifically for the fifth-generation model, and any of the previous versions won’t fit perfectly. However, all our recommendations are compatible with the 2024 11-inch iPad Pro.

 When selecting a case for your iPad, it's crucial to consider your unique needs and preferences. A rugged case is the way to go if you prioritize top-notch protection. However, remember that these cases can add bulk to your tablet. So, depending on your usage and handling, you can find the perfect balance between ruggedness and bulk that suits you best.

 Similarly, clear cases are perfect for adding reasonable protection to your device without hiding its design or the colorway. A keyboard case can add a proper keyboard and trackpad to your iPad Pro while keeping it safe.

 Rest assured, there's a wide range of iPad Pro cases available to suit every budget and style preference. Whether you're looking for a high-end design or a more affordable option, you'll find plenty of choices on the market.

| Well-spaced, detachable keyboard            | No Apple Pencil storage |
| Large, responsive, and multi-touch trackpad |                         |

[Logitech’s Combo Touch](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.920-012659.html) keyboard case for the iPad Pro 11-inch is a testament to the company's years of experience building keyboards. It’s an impressive offering that provides access to a well-spaced keyboard and a responsive trackpad.

 What sets this keyboard apart is its versatility—you can detach the keyboard when you don’t need it, making it a more flexible option than the [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Experience-Trackpad-Function/dp/B0D3J65R9N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and it's less expensive to boot.

 Among other highlights, Logitech has included a built-in kickstand that supports multiple viewing angles, and the back cover protects the iPad Pro from everyday mishaps. The Combo Touch uses the iPad Pro’s built-in pogo pins (also known as the smart connector0 to connect and get power, so you don’t have to worry about Bluetooth connection troubles or charging your keyboard.

 The keyboard case is also relatively lightweight, slim, and well-built. Additionally, you get a whole row of iPadOS shortcut keys for convenience. Unfortunately, there is no Apple Pencil storage, but Logitech has provided a cutout for charging.

JETech

| Pros                                        | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Affordable                                  | No Apple Pencil storage |
| No-frills design with reasonable protection |                         |

 The [JETech Clear Case](https://www.amazon.com/JETech-11-Inch-Anti-Yellowing-Transparent-Shockproof/dp/B0D2VPN7YR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a no-frills, high-quality offering to keep the iPad Pro safe without hiding its design or colorway. It’s slim and lightweight, but the TPU polycarbonate construction protects your tablet from bumps, dents, drops, and impacts.

 In other features, the company has included raised edges to prevent the display or camera module from getting scratched up and precise cutouts for easy access to the USB-C port, buttons, and Apple Pencil charging spot.

 Another great thing about the JETech case is its fantastic pricing. However, the case lacks storage for the Apple Pencil.

 If you prefer folio-style cases, you can alternatively consider the [OtterBox Symmetry 360](https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Symmetry-Case-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0D3JC45CK/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) with a transparent back. It has a folding front flap that can be used as a kickstand. Plus, like the company’s other cases, it offers superb drop protection.

| Pros                       | Cons                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Premium and elegant design | No Apple Pencil storage |
| Sturdy frame               |                         |

 This [top-grain leather case from Torro](https://torrousa.com/products/ipad-pro-11-leather-case-5th-gen?variant=45076729659584) is an excellent choice if you are willing to shell out more for a premium look and an elegant design. While the case's exterior is made from cowhide leather, the Torro offering uses a sturdy TPU shell for impact resistance and shock protection. A microfiber lining also keeps the iPad Pro safe from scratches.

 Unlike other folio-style cases that rely on magnets to keep the front flap closed, the Torro offering has an elastic strap that wraps around the front cover to keep it securely closed when you’re not using the iPad Pro. The case also functions as a kickstand with three viewing angles and supports smart sleep/wake functionality.

 While there is no Apple Pencil storage, the company has provided a cutout to help you charge it without removing the case.

### Can I use my old iPad Pro case with the new Pro model?

 Unfortunately, you can’t use your old iPad Pro case with the new 11-inch iPad model. The newer model has slightly different dimensions, making it unfit for the older cases.

### What is the difference between the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 13-inch iPad Pro?

 The 2024 models of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the [13-inch iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are exactly the same, except for the larger display, higher resolution, and the tablet's overall size.

### What is the difference between the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 11-inch iPad Air?

 There are quite a few differences between the 2024 models of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the [11-inch iPad Air](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5VFYQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The two slates use different processors, different display technology, and different generation USB connectors. The iPad Air also lacks Face ID support, ProRes video recording, and more. Plus, there is no 128GB model of the iPad Pro.

### Do I need the Apple Pencil Pro for my iPad Pro?

 You don’t need an Apple Pencil Pro to use the iPad Pro. It’s an optional accessory that allows you to annotate, draw, take notes, mark up, and more in your favorite apps. It’s pretty handy for content creators.

### How will the new Magic Keyboard work with my iPad Pro?

 The [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Experience-Trackpad-Function/dp/B0D3J65R9N/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003216&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-11-inch-ipad-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an official Apple accessory. Its iPad Pro 11-inch 2024 version attaches to the back of the tablet magnetically and uses the built-in pogo pins for connectivity and power. It also includes a USB-C port for charging your iPad Pro with pass-through power. You also get a large glass trackpad and a row of iPadOS shortcut keys.
