What if you could simply[tap the back of your device](https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-10-free-football-streaming-sites-to-bookmark/) to perform an action? We'll show you how to do this on your Android phone.

 There are a couple of different ways to do this, depending on the phone you have. Google Pixel devices have a built-in feature called "Quick Tap." Samsung Galaxy devices can do it with a Good Lock module. And for everyone else, you can use a third-party app called "Tap, Tap." Let's do it!

## **How to Use Quick Tap on Google Pixel** 

 "Quick Tap" on Google Pixel phones can be found at Settings > System > Gestures > Quick Tap. First, swipe down twice from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon to open the Settings.

![Tap the gear icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot_20230824-163306-1.png) 

 Now scroll down and select "System."

![Select "System."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110042.png) 

 Go to the "Gestures" section.

![Go to "Gestures."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110045.png) 

 The one we want is "Quick Tap to Start Actions."

![Select "Quick Tap to Start Actions."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110048.png) 

 Toggle the switch on and choose an action. You can do things such as take a screenshot, turn on the flashlight, play/pause music, show notifications, and even open a specific app.

![Toggle on and choose an action.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110058.png) 

 There's also an option to "Require Stronger Taps" if you find the gesture is activated too easily.

 That's all there is to it! Simply tap the back of the phone twice to activate the action.

## **How to Use Back Tap on Samsung Galaxy** 

 To use Back Tap gestures on a Samsung Galaxy device, we'll first need to install the "RegiStar" Good Lock module. Read[our full guide on how to use Good Lock](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-metaverse-mastery-rapidly-assemble-your-digital-self/) and install the RegiStar module.

![RegiStar module.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111606_good-lock.jpg) 

 In RegiStar, select "Back-Tap Action."

![Select "Back-Tap Action."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111616_registar.jpg) 

 First, turn it on at the top of the screen.

![Turn on "Back-Tap Action."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111745_registar.jpg) 

 Now, you can select actions for the "Double Tap" and "Triple Tap" gestures.

 You also have the option to see a notification when Back-Tap is triggered, adjust the sensitivity of the gesture, and add "Gates," which are conditions in which Back-Tap will be paused.

![Set up "Gates" and sensitivity.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-09-11_13-51-53.jpg) 

 You're all set! Just tap the back of the phone the number of times you decide.

## **How to Use Tap, Tap for Android** 

 Open a web browser on your Android device and head to[the GitHub page for Tap, Tap](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/TapTap). Download the most recent APK file that's available and[sideload it on your Android device](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-premium-quality-streaming-on-the-worlds-largest-network/).

![Tap, Tap app from GitHub.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_112146_edge.jpg) 

 The first thing we need to do with Tap, Tap is toggle it on at the top of the screen.

![Toggle on Tap, Tap.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130424_tap-tap.jpg) 

 You'll also want to tap "Disable Battery Optimization" to make sure it's always running in the background.

 Now, you can tap "Double Tap Actions" or "Triple Tap Actions" to choose an action for the gesture.

![Select Double Tap or Triple Tap actions.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130424_tap-tapa.jpg) 

 Note that some actions will require you to enable the Accessibility Service to run. You can do this by following the instructions in the notification.

![Enable the accessibility service.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130551_settings.jpg) 

 Each gesture can actually have multiple actions, which are executed in the order that you put them on the gesture screen. Use the handles to move around the order of operations.

 Actions can also have "Requirements" added to them. This simply means certain conditions must be met in order for the action to trigger.

 Lastly, there are "Gates." These are situations, similar to the Requirements, that will prevent the gestures from running. Requirements are for individual Actions, while Gates apply to all of them.

 That's it! As mentioned, there are a ton of options in this app. The only limitation is your imagination. You can create some very useful shortcuts if you take some time to explore.
