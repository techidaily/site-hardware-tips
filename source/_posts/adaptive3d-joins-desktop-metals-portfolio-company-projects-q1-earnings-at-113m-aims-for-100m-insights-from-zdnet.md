## Adaptive3D Joins Desktop Metal's Portfolio; Company Projects Q1 Earnings at $11.3M, Aims for $100M - Insights From ZDNet

Desktop Metal said it will acquire Adaptive3D, which makes biocompatible rubber and rubber-like materials for additive manufacturing. 

[The acquisition](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005871/en/Desktop-Metal-Acquires-Adaptive3D-Adding-Best-in-Class-Elastomer-Capabilities-to-Growing-Materials-Portfolio) gives Desktop Metal an entry into volume photopolymer elastomer parts. Adaptive3D's primary resin is Elastic ToughRubber 90 and it 3D prints parts for multiple industries including healthcare, industrial, transportation and oil and gas. 

Adaptive3D's core technology was developed through Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funding. Here's a look at the types of parts Adaptive3D makes.
