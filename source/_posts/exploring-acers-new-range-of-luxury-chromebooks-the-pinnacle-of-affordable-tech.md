## Exploring Acer's New Range of Luxury Chromebooks: The Pinnacle of Affordable Tech

A lot of us have typically associated Chromebooks with low price tags, but that's not necessarily the case. There are some higher-end Chromebooks out there with great specifications, and a higher price to match, all under the "Chromebook Plus" label. Now, Acer has just announced a couple of more expensive Chromebooks you might want to check out.

 Acer has just unveiled two new Chromebook Plus models: the Spin 714 and 516 GE. Both devices feature enhanced Intel Core processors, doubled memory and storage compared to standard Chromebooks, and support for all those cool new advanced AI features Google has been bragging about in recent weeks, like Google Photos' Magic Editor and Gemini in Google Workspace.

 The [Chromebook Plus Spin 714](https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-spin-cp714-1h-cp714-1hn) is a slim, convertible Chromebook designed for on-the-go productivity. It has a 360-degree hinge, which means that you're not only able to use it as a laptop, but as a tablet as well. Powered by up to Intel Core Ultra 7 processors, it offers long battery life and it even has a durable MIL-STD 810-certified aluminum chassis. It also has a 14-inch touchscreen display with 100% sRGB color gamut that gets the job done and ensures everything looks as crisp as possible on-screen.

 The [Chromebook Plus 516 GE](https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h), on the other hand, is one of those cool "gaming" Chromebooks that caters to cloud gaming enthusiasts, featuring a 120Hz high-resolution WQXGA display and powerful 13th Gen Intel Core i7 processors. It allows users to stream AAA games from platforms like NVIDIA GeForce NOW without downloads (remember when Google [had its own game streaming service?](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-leading-android-podcast-apps/)), and it also features DTS audio and a specialized gaming keyboard with anti-ghosting technology to enhance the gaming experience.

 Both models also offer features that boost productivity for work and school, leveraging new generative AI capabilities in ChromeOS and Adobe apps. The Spin 714 is available for enterprise and education customers with enhanced management capabilities.

 The Spin 714 starts at $749.99, while the 516 GE is available starting at $699.99\. They should be available from [Acer's online store](https://www.acer.com/us-en/) and other retailers shortly, as the press release said they would show up "in May," and we're already near the end of May.
