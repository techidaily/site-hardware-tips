## Master Reviews with Us: Unveiling the Secrets of Our How-To Geek Rigorous Testing Methods

[How-To Geek’s product reviews and recommendations](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-transform-smartphone-capabilities-into-a-professional-yt-channel/) come from the same team of experts who have helped hundreds of millions of people fix their gadgets for the past 15+ years. Each has spent years assessing the latest technology trends and can fairly evaluate a device against the competition.

 Our team goes hands-on with every product we review, with most also spending time at How-To Geek’s testing lab and office in Virginia. We benchmark everything from the CPU in the latest Windows laptop to the battery life in the newest wireless earbuds. We also use the opportunity to capture pictures and videos in our in-house photo studio, allowing readers to see the device from every angle.

 Products only stay in our office briefly, though, as our reviewers take them out into the real world and use them just like you would. They write up their findings only after extensive testing in the reviewers’ homes and daily lives.

 When the review is complete, the unit is either returned to the company or PR agency that lent it to How-To Geek or stored in Valnet’s Virginia office for long-term testing. Having the device on hand allows our editorial teams to directly compare it to similar products and share additional content on various social media channels.

 If a company doesn’t want its product back after a given amount of time, How-To Geek donates it to a local charity.

 We do not allow companies to sponsor or offer compensation for reviews. Reviews are written independently, and brands have no say in the content of our reviews. We may earn a commission if you click an affiliate link and purchase a product, but our editorial team chooses all our product recommendations independently without considering affiliate relationships.

##  How We Score Reviews

 How-To Geek rates products on a 10-point scale. Reviews are always somewhat subjective, but the editorial team combines the writer’s experience and testing with benchmarks, pricing, and product comparisons to give each item a fair score.

 Here’s what our numerical review scores translate to:

1. Does Not Work
2. Barely Functional
3. Severely Lacking in Most Areas
4. Functions, but Has Numerous Issues
5. Fine, Yet Leave a Lot to Be Desired
6. Good Enough to Buy on Sale
7. Great and Worth Purchasing
8. Fantastic, Approaching Best-in-Class
9. Best-in-Class
10. Borderline Perfection

 In very rare cases, How-To Geek might adjust a review’s rating—positively or negatively—due to changes that take place after the review is published. We will always include an update note at the top of the review explaining that a change has been made and why we believe the score needs to be modified.

##  Staff Pick

![How-To Geek Staff Pick award badge on a colorful background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-geek-staff-pick-badge-on-a-colorful-background.jpg) 

 How-To Geek evaluates hundreds of devices yearly, many of which are great gadgets. The Staff Pick badge signifies that the product is great and worth purchasing. Reviews with a score of 7 or higher typically qualify for a Staff Pick award.

 The Recommended badge is the How-To Geek stamp of approval on a product. Based on our testing, the device is fantastic, and we have no hesitation in recommending it. Products that receive a score of 8 or higher typically qualify for a Recommended award.

 How-To Geek awards its Editor’s Choice designation to products that are the best in their category. These devices are worth purchasing and beat out their closest competitors in terms of functionality, ease of use, and overall quality. The Editor's Choice recommendation is much more selective and is voted on by multiple editorial team members.

 Below are several products that received an Editor's Choice award:

* [Apple iPad Pro (M4)](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-oneplus-ace-2v-face-lock-by-drfone-android/)
