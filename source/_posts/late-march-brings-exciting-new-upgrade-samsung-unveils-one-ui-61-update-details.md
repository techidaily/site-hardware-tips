## Late March Brings Exciting New Upgrade: Samsung Unveils One UI 6.1 Update Details

The Samsung Galaxy S24 arrived with several exciting new software features in One UI 6.1, most notably the new suite of [Galaxy AI tools](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-instagram-story-tips/). And now, that same software experience and Galaxy AI goodies are about to arrive for select older phones and tablets.

 Earlier this year, Samsung confirmed that some of the Galaxy AI experience would [eventually come to older phones](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/solving-grey-voids-in-gaming-capture-software/). In late February, it was revealed that the One UI 6.1 update release date would arrive at the end of March. Unfortunately, [only last year's models](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-vivo-t2x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), like the Galaxy S23 and Z Flip/Fold 5, would get some AI features, at least for now.

 In a new [blog post from Samsung Korea](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fkr%2F%25EC%2582%25BC%25EC%2584%25B1%25EC%25A0%2584%25EC%259E%2590-%25EA%25B0%25A4%25EB%259F%25AD%25EC%258B%259C-ai-%25EC%25A0%2581%25EC%259A%25A9-%25EB%25AA%25A8%25EB%258D%25B8-%25ED%2599%2595%25EB%258C%2580-%25EA%25B8%25B0%25EB%2585%2590-%25ED%2594%2584%25EB%25A1%259C%25EB%25AA%25A8%25EC%2585%2598-%25EC%258B%25A4%3F), the company reconfirmed that its One UI 6.1 and Galaxy AI update will begin arriving later this month. One UI 6.1 should eventually roll out to a slew of phones and tablets, but we still don't have a concrete release date. The blog post states it'll arrive "from the end of this month," suggesting a very late arrival and most owners could be waiting until early April.

Samsung

 So, what can you expect from Samsung's One UI 6.1 release? It's a relatively light update, as most phones already enjoy One UI 6.0 running on Android 14\. Those with the Galaxy S23 series, the Galaxy Tab S9 series, the Galaxy Z Flip 5, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 will enjoy it the most. That's due to the addition of various Galaxy AI goodies. Some of those include Live Translate, Interpreter, Chat Assist, and Generative Edit for photos. It'll also give many phones and tablets Google's new [Circle to Search](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), an on-screen AI-powered tool that's quite neat.

 As a reminder, this is only Samsung's initial launch window, and specific regions and carrier-locked models could wait even longer. For example, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon in the US often have a longer approval process, so they'll see a slight delay.

 Keep in mind that the One UI 6.1 update should eventually arrive for far more phones and tablets in the ever-growing list of Galaxy phones, but without the new Galaxy AI features. In time, there's a slight chance Samsung will slowly trickle Galaxy AI down to other models, but it isn't very likely.
