## HP Ends Distribution of Printers Solely Integrated with Cloud Technology

We're in the era of online, always-connected devices and peripherals, but there are some cases where companies might want to take it too far. Case in point: HP had printers that could only be used while connected to a cloud service. Thankfully, HP has now discontinued them.

 HP has announced the discontinuation of its e-series LaserJet [printers](https://games-able.techidaily.com/old-vs-slim-unveiling-ps5-evolution/), along with the associated [HP+ and "Instant Ink" toner subscription services](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/has-ai-surpassed-the-old-standards-discovering-five-cutting-edge-alternatives-to-the-turing-test/). This move comes after mounting customer complaints regarding the mandatory cloud-based ecosystem and restrictions on using third-party toner cartridges. Launched in 2020, HP+ aimed to create a fully integrated cloud environment around the existing Instant Ink subscription service. However, the e-series printers, which required a constant internet connection and the use of HP-branded toner, faced criticism for their limitations.

 The company has also decided to halt the Instant Ink toner subscription service for new customers later this year, citing difficulties in meeting cloud connection requirements for certain business environments. It's not clear if existing printers that require an HP+ subscription will continue to work following the discontinuation of the service—we'd assume HP will update the printers so they keep working and not become just a paperweight.

 HP's decision reflects a shift away from its previous strategy of locking customers into subscription plans to generate recurring revenue. This approach had seen significant success, with over 11 million subscribers and double-digit revenue growth in 2022\. However, the company is now facing a class-action lawsuit in the US over firmware updates that allegedly disabled printers using non-HP cartridges. This, coupled with the growing dissatisfaction with the HP+ ecosystem, has likely contributed to the company's decision to discontinue the e-series printers and associated services.

 If you have one of these printers, we'd certainly recommend you to reach out to HP to see what will happen to it.
