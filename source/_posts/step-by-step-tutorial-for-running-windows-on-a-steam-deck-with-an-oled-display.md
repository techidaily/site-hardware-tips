## Step-by-Step Tutorial for Running Windows on a Steam Deck with an OLED Display

The Steam Deck uses a Linux-based operating system, but you can install Windows for better game compatibility, at the expense of battery life and other features. Valve has now released official Windows drivers for the higher-end Steam Deck OLED.

 Valve has finally released Windows drivers for its Steam Deck OLED, ten months after the device's initial launch. If you prefer Windows and you want to enjoy things such better WiFi, Bluetooth, and audio functionality while running the OS on your handheld gaming PC, then this will certainly be helpful. You can download them from [Valve's official Windows Resources page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8) for the Steam Deck.

 The Steam Deck OLED was first released in November 2023 as an upgraded version of the original Steam Deck, with a brighter OLED screen, enhanced memory and connectivity, and a larger battery. Even though performance is similar to the original Steam Deck, there are some internal hardware changes. Those changes mean that you'll need another set of drivers if you want to enjoy Windows on your handheld, which Valve has now provided.

 The delayed release of these drivers makes it clear that Windows support remains a secondary priority for Valve, despite the company's efforts to enable dual-booting. Even with SteamOS 3's availability, official dual-boot support through the SteamOS installer is still pending. Thankfully, third-party tools like SteamDeck\_rEFInd and Clover provide workarounds if you wish to install both operating systems at the same time.

 Before installing Windows on a Steam Deck OLED, remember to update the BIOS to the latest version, which is available with SteamOS Beta 3.6.9 or later. This step is crucial for ensuring Bluetooth functionality on Windows. Once that step is out of the way, then you should be able to install Windows 11 on your handheld by following [the same steps you would follow on a regular Steam Deck](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-pinpointing-the-10-most-discreet-story-advocates/).
