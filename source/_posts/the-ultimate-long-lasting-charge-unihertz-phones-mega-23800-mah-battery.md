## The Ultimate Long-Lasting Charge: Unihertz Phone's Mega 23,800 mAh Battery

These days, it's not uncommon to see phones coming with roughly 4,000 mAh or 5,000 mAh batteries. While battery life might vary from device to device, you can get a solid day of use out of a single charge with most phones. Most smartphone makers try to hit a balance between battery size and actual smartphone size, but if you don't care at all about the latter, the latest phone from Unihertz might be for you.

 Chinese smartphone brand Unihertz, a company with a history of selling niche and non-conventional Android devices, has released the Unihertz Tank 3\. The phone's standout feature is its 23,800 mAh battery. That's around 4 to 5 times larger than the battery in a typical smartphone, and probably bigger than the battery in your [power bank](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), too. It's also _just_ shy of the \~27,000 mAh maximum that IATA will allow on planes. It is a _big_ phone as a result, being roughly 1.2 inches thick and weighing a whopping 1.47 pounds (or 666 grams). But it also means that under all metrics, this phone will last a long time.

Unihertz

 Unihertz says that the battery can last 38 hours playing games, 98 hours playing music, and 118 hours calling, as well as 1800 hours on standby (\~2.5 months). The phone also has 120W charging, so that massive battery can be charged up to 90% in just about 1.5 hours. Fast charging has been absent on some other attempts at phones with larger batteries, so it's great to see that slow charging times shouldn't be an issue.

 The phone comes with a MediaTek Dimensity 8200 SoC for its guts, as well as up to 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, a 200MP rear camera, a 50MP front camera, and Android 13\. It even comes with some cool additions, including a 1200-lumen flashlight, an IR blaster, and even a 40-meter laser range finder. This is a phone that is clearly intended to be used off the grid.

 The Unihertz Tian 3 is only available in China right now, and can be bought internationally through AliExpress. It likely won't work in the United States due to a lack of certification by US carriers, but it might come to America at some point in the future.
