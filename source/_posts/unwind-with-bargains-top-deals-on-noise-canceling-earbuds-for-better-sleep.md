## Unwind with Bargains: Top Deals on Noise-Canceling Earbuds for Better Sleep

Need to get some sleep? Drown out sound with these sleep headphones.

[Sleep headphones](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-golden-geographies-revealed-the-best-map-locations/) can be a lifesaver if you're a light sleeper. You can drown out noise with white noise or music, which means you won't wake up to every tiny sound in the house. However, finding the right headphones for the job is not always easy. Even if you sleep on your back or stomach, regular [noise-cancelling headphones](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-itel-a60-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/) are too heavy to keep on your head—and if you sleep on your side, it was never an option in the first place.

 Instead, you can opt for sleep headphones that are headbands, and they _can_ be a great solution. However, if you get hot at night or don't like your eyes covered, they can be uncomfortable. The Philips Sleep Headphones offer a different design—instead of going over your forehead, the device sits on the back of your head, keeping your forehead uncovered. Then, you can use the Kokoon app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003321/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kokoon.app.v2) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/vg/app/kokoon/id1533992618) to create a sound profile to drown out the noise and get some blissful sleep. The Kokoon app does require a subscription, but you can also use any audio on your phone as you would a normal pair of headphones.

 Also, it's important to note that these headphones are not [active noise-cancelling](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) headphones—Kokoon instead calls these 'Noise Masking' headphones. These work in a similar concept to white noise in that it'll omit sound at all frequencies to drown out noise coming from other areas. It's really helpful if small noises from pets or nocturnal housemates are keeping you up.

 Normally, the Philips Sleep Headphones will set you back $250, which is a bit steep. However, they're currently on sale, and you can grab one pair for $178 with the code **SLUMBER10**. It's the perfect time to pic these up and try them out!
