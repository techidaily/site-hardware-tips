 The Asus TUF Gaming VG34VQEL1A monitor features a curved VA panel that spans 34 inches across its diagonal. According to Asus, the curvature is graded at 1500R. It has a UWQHD resolution which measures in at 3,440 x 1,440 pixels. It has a refresh rate that caps out at 100 Hz which is far from the highest we've ever seen but isn't too bad for most gaming needs. It also has a response time that can get as low as 1ms.

 The monitor covers 125% of the sRGB color gamut, which seems decent. However, the maximum brightness figure of 300nits isn't that bright, so this monitor would be best used in a dim room. There are two 2W speakers built-in for[audio](https://tools.techidaily.com) output but a 3.5mm jack is provided for connecting external AV peripherals, as well. For video input, you've got both a DisplayPort input and two HDMI ports to use. The purchase is supported by a manufacturer's warranty from Asus as well as Amazon's 30-day return policy.
