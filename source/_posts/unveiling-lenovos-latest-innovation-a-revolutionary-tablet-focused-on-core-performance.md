## Unveiling Lenovo's Latest Innovation: A Revolutionary Tablet Focused on Core Performance

Lenovo might not be the first name that comes to mind for tablets, especially in the United States, but the company has a few solid options in that category. The latest one is the Lenovo Tab Plus, but it might be more speaker than tablet.

 The Lenovo Tab Plus is a new Android tablet built first and foremost for entertainment. It has a large 11.5-inch 2K screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, a built-in kickstand for “up to 175 degrees of viewing flexibility,” a MediaTek G99 chipset, 256GB of internal storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion. The tablet also ships with Android 14 out of the box.

 The main selling point here is the eight integrated speakers: four matrix tweeters and four force-balanced woofers. The speakers have a combined output of 26W, with 22 cubic centimeters (22cc) of internal volume. The audio system is also branded as “designed and engineered with JBL.” Those substantial speakers make the tablet bulkier than most of its competitors, but it still has a sleek design, and it will almost certainly sound better than every other tablet out there.

 Lenovo said in a press release, “To maximize the tablet’s functionality and audio system designed and engineered with JBL, the Lenovo Tab Plus transforms into a Bluetooth® speaker for seamless audio anywhere, streamed from your portable device like a smartphone, and comes with an integrated kickstand for up to 175 degrees of viewing flexibility. For the utmost sonar customization, it comes with a personalized app volume control that lets you fine-tune audio settings. With the app volume control, the tablet automatically cranks up the volume when your favorite music or podcast app is open, lowers the sound when a browser is chosen, and more.”

 The tablet is also compatible with the [Lenovo Tab Pen Plus](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Faccessories-and-software%2Ftablet-accessories%2Ftablet-accessories_android-tablets%2Fzg38c05194), so you can use it for basic handwriting and sketch work (the kickstand is probably great for that). It also has an 8,600 mAh battery with support for 45W charging over USB Type-C.

 Most Android tablets don’t have extended software support, especially in comparison to the Apple iPad lineup. Lenovo is promising two years of major Android OS updates for the Tab Plus, and four years of security patches (until June 2028). That’s not _amazing_, especially since there’s no guarantee of the frequency of those security patches, but it’s about average for the Android tablet ecosystem. By comparison, the five-year-old 7th gen iPad [will get iPadOS 18](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-18-preview/) when it arrives later this year.
