_PC Building Simulator_ 's popularity always seemed a bit weird. People would spend a bunch of money on PC compnents, assemble their own gaming setup and then buy a game about [building PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) ? It sounds like an indie art film. But now the game has reached a brand new audience that can enjoy it without a hint of irony:_PC Building Simulator_ [launched](https://theirregularcorporation.com/en%5Fgb/pc-building-simulator-console-edition) yesterday on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

 Don't let the intro fool you--we're[among the people who bought](https://tools.techidaily.com) _PC Building Simulator_ despite spending all day with a real PC. The game isn't just about fitting parts into the right places. There's an entire business management simulator here, too, for people who prefer having to manage virtual dollars to managing real ones. Others can simply enjoy putting (virtual) systems together without breaking the bank.

_PC Building Simulator_ 's journey to consoles might have another benefit, too, which is showing console gamers that assembling a PC can be fun. It can be hard for many enthusiasts to remember, but[building a custom PC for the first time](https://tools.techidaily.com) can actually be pretty daunting. What parts should you buy? Do you need a degree from ITT Tech to put everything together? What if something blows up in their faces?
