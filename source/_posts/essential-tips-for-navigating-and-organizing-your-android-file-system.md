### Key Takeaways

 Android devices include a built-in file manager typically called "My Files" or just "Files." It can be used to access downloads and unzip files. There are many third-part file manager apps available in the Play Store.

 One of Android's best features is its file system and file manager apps. You don't have to [wonder what's taking up space](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-expert-tips-for-youtube-channel-aesthetics-finding-optimal-sizes/)\---it's all accessible to you. We'll show you where to find certain things, and share some great file managers.

##  Where Is the File Manager on Android?

 The built-in file manager on [Samsung Galaxy devices](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-connecting-consciously-with-content-craftsmen-of-your-realm-for-2024/) is called "My Files," while Google Pixel phones and some other Android phones use the "[Files by Google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files)" app. Regardless of device, the file manager is typically named something like "My Files" or just plain "Files," and it can be found in the app drawer.

 Another way to find the file manager is to install an app called "[Files Shortcut](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aospstudio.files)." As the name implies, this app is simply a shortcut to the stock file manager found on every Android device. It will probably look different than the file manager included by your phone's maker. There are no permissions required for the app---it's literally just a shortcut.

##  How to Find Downloads on Android

 Downloaded files will be saved to the aptly named "Downloads" folder in your device's file manager. To begin, open the file manager on your [Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) or [tablet](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/16757146-updated-bite-sized-video-knowledge-now/). In this example, we're using the stock Android file manager, which can be launched with the "[Files Shortcut](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aospstudio.files)" app.

 First, open the file manager on your Android device. You may see the "Downloads" or "Download" folder immediately.

!["Download" folder.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot_20230410-162030.png) 

 If you don't see the "Downloads" folder on the first screen, navigate to the "Internal Storage" section.

![Go to "Internal Storage."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot_20230410-162045.png) 

 Now you should see a "Download" folder.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 All of your downloaded files can be found in this folder.

![Inside the &quot;Download&quot; folder.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot_20230410-162057.png) 

 The process is similar if you're using the "[Files by Google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files)" app. First, open the app on your Android device and make sure you're on the "Browse" tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Tap the "Downloads" option, and then you'll see all of your downloaded documents and files.

![downloads in files by google](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find-downloads-android-1.png) 

 That's it! In the vast majority of cases, anything you download from a web browser like Google Chrome will be [saved to your Android device's "Downloads" folder](https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/methods-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-6-plus-to-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/).

##  How to Unzip Files on Android

 To unzip files on Android, you'll need to use [Files by Google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files) or another file manager app to locate and extract the contents of the ZIP file. We'll show you how it works with the Files by Google app, which anyone can [download from the Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220481/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files).

 First, open the app and locate the ZIP file you would like to extract.

![Select the zip file to extract.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2023-01-26_10-49-49.jpg) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 A menu will appear with the contents of the ZIP file displayed and an option to "Extract." Tap "Extract" to continue.

![Tap the &quot;Extract&quot; button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2023-01-26_10-51-06.jpg) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After the progress bar shows the extraction is complete, tap "Done" to finish up. You'll have the option to select "Delete ZIP File" if you'd like to remove the original ZIP after it's been extracted.

![Select &quot;Delete ZIP File&quot; and tap &quot;Done.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2023-01-26_10-52-04.jpg) 

 The extracted files will be in a folder with the same name as the ZIP file in the original location. Thankfully, it's pretty easy to unzip a file on Android, [but a little trickier to zip files together](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/simple-steps-correcting-discords-js-errors-effortlessly/).

 It's nice that Android doesn't hide the file system too much, even though you probably don't need to use a file manager very often. When you do, it's helpful to have the option to dig into it just like you [would do on Windows](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-youtube-channel-aesthetics-essential-size-and-dimension-tips/) or [MacOS](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-creator-to-earnings-successful-youtube-short-strategies/). A robust file system is one of the things that makes Android so powerful.
