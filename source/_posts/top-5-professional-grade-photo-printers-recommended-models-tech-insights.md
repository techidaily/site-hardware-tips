## Top 5 Professional-Grade Photo Printers : Recommended Models - Tech Insights

When you have spent your time and energy editing and perfecting your great photos, using the wrong printer to wrap up the process can severely impact their quality. 

Typical home printers will contain three to four ink reservoirs, whereas top-end photographic printers may contain 10 or more reservoirs to bring out as much color and depth in prints as possible. Inkjet models, combined with photo paper specifically designed for photography, are often considered the best option -- but if you want to mass-produce images for purposes such as marketing or flyers quickly (and with lower quality), a laser model is still a possible option.

You also need to consider the paper size of prints that you want, whether or not you need double-sided print capabilities, and if Wi-Fi connectivity or direct-from-card printing is important to you during workflows. 

There are some printers, too, that are inexpensive to buy but require a second mortgage for the ink or toner. When you're considering which printer suits you best, you should also consider whether you need one purely for photography purposes -- or if you plan to combine black and white document printing and color photos, for example, it might even be worth preserving one solely for image work to cut down on ink costs. 

Below, ZDNET has compiled our top picks for high-quality photo printers on the market that will suit a variety of purposes and budgets.

| **Photo** **printer**         | **Price** | **Image** **resolution**               |

## Which is the right photo printer for you?

The first point to consider is whether or not you want prints to enjoy in your own home or whether you need a printer with the functionality to act as a business or marketing tool. When your images appear in a portfolio, you want them to look their best as an asset -- but you might not need extremely high quality if printing is going to be on an occasional basis for friends or family. If you're handing out marketing materials or flyers, too, printing must be financially viable. 

A printer, in the same way as a camera kit, can be an investment into a business or hobby alike -- and so you should consider what you are willing to spend. 

| **Choose this photo printer...** | **If you want...**                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Canon imagePROGRAF PRO-1000      | The best overall option                              |
| HP Envy Photo 7155               | A budget-friendly photo printer                      |
| HP Color LaserJet Pro            | A photo printer for your business                    |
| Epson Expression Photo XP-970    | A photo printer that can also copy and scan          |
| Kodak Dock Plus                  | A portable photo printer that connects to your phone |

## How did we choose these photo printers?

We wanted to make sure we covered products suitable for various budgets, as creative and photographic activities can quickly become expensive while also considering the printers that offered the best image quality. 

## Which image format is best for photo printing?

Most images are in JPEG format, and this is the best-compressed image format for photo printing, especially when printing photographs and artworks. TIFF and PDF formats are also excellent for photo printing. 

## What is the big deal about the number of ink tanks?

While many entry and mid-range printers will come with three, four, or five tanks, for professional purposes, printers can go beyond 10 tanks -- vastly increasing the color depth possible. 

However, the more the number of tanks, the more it can cost to keep a printer running. 

## What is the difference between matte black and photo black ink?

Photo, or "standard" black, will be set on normal and glossy paper types. However, matte black is suitable for matte and art paper.

## What is the best photo printer for iPhone?

The best photo printer for an [Apple iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) is the Kodak Dock Plus printer since it produces hard image copies on the go and easily connects to an iOS device via Bluetooth.

## What is the difference between an inkjet and a laser printer?

[Inkjet models](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-inkjet-printer/) are generally considered superior when it comes to printing images as laser printers can often only produce mid-range quality prints due to toner limitations. 

However, if you want quick prints for business and marketing materials in quantity, [laser models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laser-printer/) might be the better bet. 

## Are there alternative photo printers worth considering?

We considered pricing, ease of use, and other needs when coming up with the best photo printers. However, if these options don't work for you, here are a few more worthy alternatives to consider:
